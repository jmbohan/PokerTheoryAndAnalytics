Develop the basic foundation for decision-making in poker. Allow students to assess their own level of play and have a framework for improvement. Provide an understanding of the current poker environment and how students might leverage talent for poker in the future. Topics Basic Strategy Analysis Techniques and Applications Preflop Analysis Tournament Play Poker Economics Game Theory Decision Making Grading Requirements Gameplay - Cash in at least one or play at least 10 (Beginners Only) Daily Turbos on PokerStars Casework - Pass all three cases Attendance - Attend at least 6 of 8 lectures Policy on Collaborations You may interact with fellow students when preparing your homework solutions. However, you must write up solutions on your own. Duplicating a solution that someone else has written or providing solutions to be copied is not acceptable. If you do collaborate on homework, you must cite, in your written solution, your collaborators. If you use sources beyond the course materials in one of your solutions, you must also cite such sources.\nCalendar LEC # TOPICS KEY DATES 1 Introduction 2 Analytical Techniques (Guest: Joel Fried) 3 Basic Strategy Case 1 Out 4 Preflop Analysis Case 1 Due Case 2 Out 5 Tournament Play Case 2 Due Case 3 Out 6 Poker Economics (Guest: Aaron Brown) Case 3 Due 7 Game Theory (Guest: Bill Chen) 8 Decision Making (Guest: Matt Hawrilenko) PokerStars Home League Pokerstars has created a play-money Home League for this MIT course for registered students. Each student must begin playing Beginners Only Turbos before moving on to Daily Turbos. Beginners Only Turbos pay out the top 20% and cashing in at least one of these tournaments (or alternatively playing in ten) is a requirement for passing the course.\nTournament Leaderboard Points League rankings are based on tournament leaderboard points, which are paid out in a way similar to tournament prizes. With the exception of the Beginners Only Turbos, TLB points are paid out to the top 34% of players, according to the following formula:\n\\( Points = if \\:\\: [ k \u0026gt; n * 0.34 ] \\:\\: then \\:\\: [ 0 ] \\: \\: else \\:\\: n * { { \\sqrt{n} \\over \\sqrt{k} } \\over { \\sum_{x=1}^{int(.34n)} {\\sqrt{n} \\over \\sqrt{x}} } } \\)\nn is the number of entrants\nk is the place of finish (k=1 for the first-place finisher, and so on)\nSo first place in a 10-person turbo would earn you 4.38 TLB points, second would earn 3.10, and third would earn 2.52 for a total of 10.0 points awarded.\nDaily Tournament Schedule Note that the information listed below about the schedule is for archival purposes.
