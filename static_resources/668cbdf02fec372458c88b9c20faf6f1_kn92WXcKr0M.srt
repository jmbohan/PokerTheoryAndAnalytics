8
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:27,316
PROFESSOR: Everyone,
welcome back

9
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:28,565
to Poker Theory and Analytics.

10
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:31,760
We're very lucky today to have a
guest speaker, Matt Hawrilenko.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,340
Matt's background is
really interesting.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,130
He was a Princeton grad who
went to work for a Cisco

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,880
International group
for a couple of years,

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,838
and then he left to become
a professional poker

15
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:41,640
player full time.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,180
He was considered one of the
best limit hold'em players

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,165
in the world in addition to
winning a World Series of Poker

18
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:48,070
bracelet.

19
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,720
More recently he
retired from poker

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,380
and is focusing on
clinical psychology

21
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,910
where he studies in
Boston at both Clark

22
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,730
University and Harvard.

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,570
So with that, I'll pass it
along to Matt Hawrilenko.

24
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,920
[APPLAUSE]

25
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:04,739
MATT HAWRILENKO: OK.

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,238
Hey.

27
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:07,230
So I'm super excited
to be here today.

28
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,280
And as I understand, I've been
told that I'm your second game

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,680
theory guy.

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,391
And I guess Bill, Bill
Chen, one of my best friends

31
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,890
in poker who I've
done a lot of work

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,807
with came in and talked
to you guys last week.

33
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm going to take a
slightly different angle

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,930
than Bill did last week.

35
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,880
So first I kind of
just want to get

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,290
a sense of who's in the room.

37
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,530
So my presumption
is that there might

38
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,780
be sort of like widely
varying levels of experience

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,080
with game theory.

40
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,450
So if you just don't mind
kind of helping me out,

41
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,890
so who here has seen a
game theory game before,

42
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,950
like prisoner's dilemma,
something like that?

43
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,450
OK.

44
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,702
So most of us.

45
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:47,160
Who here has actually solved
a couple of game theory games,

46
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,376
like with pen and paper,
matrix algebra, whatever?

47
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,252
OK.

48
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:52,900
About half.

49
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,680
Has anyone actually taken
a game theory class?

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,320
All right.

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,180
Great.

52
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,410
So I'm kind of
hoping this talk is

53
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,620
sort of going to be equally
useful for everyone,

54
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,730
but we'll find out.

55
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,850
So Bill talked to you guys
about Cepheus last week.

56
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,270
I'm going to talk about
something a little different

57
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,520
than Bill usually talks about.

58
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,700
So I'm going to try to talk
about how to play good poker.

59
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,820
And so if we think of this
problem of playing good poker

60
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,100
is this big game space.

61
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,700
There are two ways that
people generally approach it

62
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,430
in that they'll take a
read-based approach, which

63
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,990
is pretty much what
everybody does, right?

64
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,230
You try to figure out
what the other guy has,

65
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,185
what he might have,
and go from there.

66
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:38,890
You can take a game
theoretic approach.

67
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,850
So I'm going to try
today discriminate

68
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,080
a little bit between
these two approaches,

69
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,460
and I'm going to talk about
why, whatever level of poker

70
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,250
you're at, game theory is
something they can complement

71
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,190
your game or just be your game.

72
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,480
For me it is my game.

73
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:56,180
And broadly speaking,
the reason that I

74
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,570
think game theory is
particularly useful for poker

75
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,290
goes something like this.

76
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,180
So one of the things that
I love to do off the table,

77
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,722
I do jujitsu.

78
00:03:05,722 --> 00:03:07,096
Which if you guys
don't know what

79
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:09,510
that is, it's kind of like
wrestling where you're trying

80
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,210
to choke the guy or hyperextend
their arm or something

81
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,190
like that.

82
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,900
And when you start
out doing jujitsu,

83
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,500
you start out as a white belt,
and you're competing against,

84
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,770
rolling with other white belts.

85
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,620
And you can learn this
whole repertoire of moves.

86
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,410
And tons of stuff works
against white belts, right?

87
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,910
Like, whatever you
do, it's probably

88
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,900
going to work
against white belts.

89
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,960
As you get better
or as you start

90
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,310
going against better
competition-- blue belts,

91
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,440
purple, brown,
black belts-- a lot

92
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,370
of the moves that worked against
white belts don't work anymore.

93
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,200
Not only do they
not work, they can

94
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,630
tend to get you in
quite a lot of trouble.

95
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,370
So I think that the
best way to approach

96
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,740
this game is from
day one, you're not

97
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,290
training to be white belts.

98
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,080
You're training to be
black belts, right?

99
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,070
You want to learn the moves
that work all the way along

100
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,527
against the best competition.

101
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,860
And I think it's sort of the
same way with poker, right?

102
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,026
So if you think about it,
if you play in a home game

103
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:06,810
or whatever with a
bunch of buddies,

104
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,600
you might have one strategy
that works fairly well, right?

105
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,701
Maybe you play really tight, you
bet a lot with your best hands,

106
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:15,950
and you don't bluff that much.

107
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,870
And this works really
well because most people

108
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,450
don't really have a
sense of what's what,

109
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,760
of the strength of hands.

110
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,230
They overvalue their hands.

111
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,650
So you take that
strategy to the Bellagio

112
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,900
and you play in even mid limit
games with reasonable players,

113
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,480
and all of a sudden you're
starting to get eaten alive.

114
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,810
So I'm going to talk about how
game theory can sort of help

115
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,740
you avoid this and help you
be strong and grow stronger

116
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,199
all the way along.

117
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,740
So now if we think
about game theory,

118
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,720
really there are two audiences
that we could be speaking to,

119
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,220
right?

120
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,240
So Bill came in last
week and he talked

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,740
about Cepheus, this algorithm
that solved my best game.

122
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,100
And, well, that is sad for me.

123
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,320
I'm not going to spend a lot
of time dwelling on that here.

124
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,130
Rather I'm going to talk
about what humans can do,

125
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,270
how humans can apply game theory
at the table to their game.

126
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,950
And this is for a
couple of reasons,

127
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,590
but maybe the bigger one is
I've had a fair bit of math,

128
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,740
but I can't solve the kinds of
problems that Bill can solve.

129
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,850
But my work has sort of
been on taking game theory,

130
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,150
taking these concepts,
and really using them

131
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,170
in a practical sense.

132
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,760
So that's what I want
to talk about today.

133
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,730
So if we're thinking
about this there

134
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,320
are, again, a couple
angles we could take.

135
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,486
We could talk about it from
a theoretic perspective.

136
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:37,770
We could solve a lot of games.

137
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,350
We could solve
dynamical systems,

138
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,580
and see how that works.

139
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,290
Or we could talk
about it in practice.

140
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,539
What does game theory tell me?

141
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:46,957
How does it tell me I should
think about this situation?

142
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:48,540
Of course, I think
the theory practice

143
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,370
dichotomy is a false economy.

144
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,120
So what I want to do is I want
to spend a little bit a time

145
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,900
solving some really, really
simple toy games, two toy

146
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,720
games.

147
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,070
And I want to sort of use
that to bridge the theory

148
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,330
and practice gap.

149
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,580
So I want to take a
couple of toy games

150
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,180
and then apply them to a real
hand of high stakes poker

151
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,680
I played.

152
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,375
So I'm going to use that
hand to motivate how we might

153
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,760
apply some of these ideas.

154
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,780
So then finally at
the end of the day,

155
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,350
we can come up
with a list, right?

156
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,320
We can think of a
rule-based strategy.

157
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,670
That's something that learning
from Cepheus might give you.

158
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,572
It might tell you what to do
in every specific situation.

159
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:30,530
But that's really hard.

160
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,350
Poker's really big.

161
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,390
You can't really
remember all of that.

162
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,540
So the thing that I really hope
you guys take away from my talk

163
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,190
today is some training
principles, some ways

164
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,170
to think about the game which,
as you finish this class

165
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,810
I guess in a couple of days and
move on throughout your poker

166
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,480
careers, whatever
those might be,

167
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,980
some tools that can
sort of help you

168
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,880
continue working on your game.

169
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,025
So let's just get going.

170
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:05,300
So sometimes in poker we get
put in really tough spots,

171
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,340
and it can start to
feel like we're trying

172
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,770
to guess our way out of them.

173
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,840
Varying degrees of guess
our way out of them.

174
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,960
Sometimes we might be sort
of making educated guesses,

175
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,740
sometimes they might
be less educated.

176
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,220
But what do we do?

177
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,450
What do you do in that really
tough spot where you just

178
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,800
don't know what's going on?

179
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,480
So this happened to me a
couple of years ago in-- this

180
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,830
happens to me all the time.

181
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,439
But this happened to me a couple
of years ago in a World Series

182
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,480
tournament that I played.

183
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,021
We were deep.

184
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:37,229
We were in the money.

185
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:39,270
And the one thing I want
you guys to keep in mind

186
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,353
here is I'm playing this
hand against a player who

187
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:43,970
is just much better than me.

188
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,090
So that sucks.

189
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,720
On the other hand, I have aces.

190
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,830
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take you really

191
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,790
briefly through the hand and
let you know how I was thinking

192
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,920
about it, and we'll
kind of look at it

193
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,550
from a couple perspectives.

194
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,810
So we're both
really, really deep.

195
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,666
The blinds are 12 and
24,000 with a $3,000 ante,

196
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,540
and we're six handed.

197
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,206
So I raise two off
the button with aces.

198
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:09,070
I raise a little bit, he calls.

199
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,640
Flop comes, king, jack, eight.

200
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,190
He checks, I bet, he calls.

201
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,940
It turns a five.

202
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,880
He checks, I bet
about 2/3 of the pot.

203
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,800
He calls.

204
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,300
And then the river's a king.

205
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,470
And then he reaches for
his chips, and I feel good.

206
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,570
I'm like, oh, money.

207
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:29,070
And then he bets just about
$1.1 million to a $700,000 pot.

208
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,095
And now I'm like, I don't know.

209
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,086
I have no idea.

210
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:34,169
So he's betting I'm happy.

211
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,419
I see the amount.

212
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,340
I'm confused.

213
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,530
So here's how the hand looks.

214
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,882
So I'm sitting
there and I'm just

215
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:45,340
trying to get a
sense of his range,

216
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,210
and I'm thinking, like,
bet of 1.5 times the pot.

217
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,590
What does that mean?

218
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,570
What kind of hands is
he betting so much with?

219
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,540
Why isn't he putting me all in?

220
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,950
Why is it a little below all in?

221
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,350
Is he trying to entice me?

222
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,930
Or maybe he's trying to
save $300,000 if I fold.

223
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,100
All these thoughts are
going through my head.

224
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,045
So before we talk about what
I did, I'm actually curious.

225
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,170
Are you guys happy with
the information I gave you?

226
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,769
Is there more information
that you want?

227
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:11,810
What do you want to know?

228
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,445
AUDIENCE: How big is the
gap between getting out

229
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:15,831
now and getting out next?

230
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:17,330
MATT HAWRILENKO:
Ooh, good question.

231
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,519
So let's just say it's
pretty linear at this point.

232
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,060
AUDIENCE: OK.

233
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:27,132
MATT HAWRILENKO: Anything
else you want to know?

234
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,310
Oh, you want to know lots.

235
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,920
What do you want to know?

236
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,870
AUDIENCE: Has he
shown down big bluffs?

237
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,010
MATT HAWRILENKO: Has he
shown down big bluffs?

238
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,342
Good question, we've played
with him a little bit,

239
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:39,950
and I don't actually recall.

240
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,335
But he's certainly capable
of showing down big bluffs.

241
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:45,800
I fancied myself a pretty
good player at the time,

242
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,799
and he is someone that
I would consider one

243
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,090
of the top players in the game.

244
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,700
Anything else?

245
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,250
Anyone else?

246
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,833
Any questions?

247
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,270
Right.

248
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,350
And so it sounds
like what you're

249
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,350
trying to do is you're
trying to get a sense of,

250
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,401
what is his range?

251
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:05,150
Does he have a lot of
bluffs in this spot?

252
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,700
Does he have any
bluffs in this spot?

253
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,587
And I think that's how
pretty much most of us

254
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:12,670
tend to approach the game.

255
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,580
It's most natural way
to approach the game.

256
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,810
Is he bluffing, isn't he?

257
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,030
Does he have too
many bluffs here?

258
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,530
Out of curiosity,
does anyone want

259
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,129
to stare him down for tells?

260
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,420
Nobody wants to stare him down.

261
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,795
You might want to
stare him down.

262
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:28,238
This guy wants to
stare him down.

263
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:30,437
[LAUGHTER]

264
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:32,270
This guy definitely
wants to stare him down.

265
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,237
This guy wants to stare
him down for sure.

266
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,070
By the way, if you get
this look, good work.

267
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,320
It means you've done your job.

268
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,210
It's uncomfortable.

269
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,560
But I want to tell you exactly
what he's thinking right now.

270
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,850
What he's thinking goes
something kind of like this.

271
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,290
[MUSIC PLAYING]

272
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,460
But it can feel
like this, right?

273
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,660
Tough players can put us in
spots where we're just thinking

274
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,870
about monkeys clashing symbols.

275
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,400
And when we don't
have a repertoire,

276
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,700
I think, that we start
reading really heavily

277
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,970
into small signals, right?

278
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,320
We're trying to
figure something out.

279
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,730
So generally speaking,
my view, there

280
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,440
are some tells that are OK.

281
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,480
There are some tells that kind
of work against weak players

282
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,190
and less and less
against better players.

283
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,810
But these are small signals
in a whole lot of noise.

284
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,570
Very small signal in a
very noisy environment.

285
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,840
Certainly not something to
build a career on, right?

286
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,365
In the big games,
you rarely see tells.

287
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:38,740
You just don't see them enough
for that to be profitable.

288
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,650
But actually some people
do build careers on them.

289
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,720
So FBI interrogators
build careers

290
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,640
on these kinds of tells.

291
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,444
So how do they do?

292
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,360
Well, we actually have
some data in that spot.

293
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,068
There have been a
whole series of studies

294
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:56,670
where basically the paradigm
is you bring in some FBI

295
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,150
interrogators, and then you
bring in some random people

296
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,190
from the street.

297
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,020
And you have them watch
someone interview a person.

298
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,270
And then at the end of the
day you have to figure out,

299
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:09,940
is this person telling the
truth, or is this person lying?

300
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,430
How do you think they do?

301
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,140
AUDIENCE: Same.

302
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,056
MATT HAWRILENKO: Same?

303
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:13,930
Yeah.

304
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,500
Same in every category.

305
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,820
So everyone is basically
chance, or maybe like 53%.

306
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,940
So they do exactly the
same as the random people

307
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,940
off the street, these
body language experts,

308
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,960
except for one difference.

309
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,960
The one difference is they
are way more confident

310
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,521
that they are right, OK?

311
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:33,270
So you ask them their
level of confidence,

312
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,200
and most people are
like, eh, I don't know.

313
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,400
Like 50%.

314
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,110
The interrogators are, like,
90% sure that they're right.

315
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,575
So they're not alone, right?

316
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:46,200
So I don't know if you guys have
heard of self-assessment bias.

317
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,210
It's one of my favorite biases.

318
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,370
So one more study.

319
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,620
So it was sort of motivated by
this old study of GE engineers.

320
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,200
It's like 30 years ago.

321
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,380
And what they do is they ask,
OK, of all the engineers at GE,

322
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,300
where do you rank?

323
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,980
What is your percentile
rank of everyone?

324
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,620
And they ask basically everyone.

325
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,030
So you would think
these being engineers,

326
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,660
engineers being math
guys, that they have

327
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,140
a good sense of percentiles.

328
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,160
You'd think that they
might get this right.

329
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,982
The average engineer
ranks themself right

330
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:21,190
about at the 80th percentile.

331
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,657
Of all the people
they asked-- they

332
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:27,990
asked, like, maybe a hundred
of them-- of all the people

333
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,850
they asked, two ranked
themselves as below average.

334
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,310
That is my favorite data
point from this study.

335
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,620
Two ranked themselves
as below average.

336
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,550
Should be about half.

337
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,450
And they're not
alone too, right?

338
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,881
So poker players also famous
for their self-assessment bias.

339
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:46,630
And one of the things
that I think sort of

340
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,080
feeds into this,
at the beginning

341
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,700
of Rounders-- I haven't seen
this movie for, like, five

342
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:49,820
years.

343
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,910
I don't know if you
guys have seen Rounders.

344
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,374
But at the beginning
of Rounders,

345
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,290
Matt Damon's character
quotes this poker book.

346
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,915
It's one of my all
time favorite quotes

347
00:13:56,915 --> 00:14:00,230
from a poker movie which,
I guess, isn't saying much.

348
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,740
But gives this
quote, "Few players

349
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,590
can remember the big
pots they've won,

350
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,640
but every player can remember
with remarkable accuracy

351
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,430
the outstanding tough
beats of their career."

352
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,310
And I think it's these
sort of memory biases

353
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,690
that feed into our
self-assessment bias, right?

354
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,350
So you walk into the Bellagio,
you see a table of all pros.

355
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,960
There has to be self-assessment
bias here, right?

356
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,840
There has to be.

357
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,479
So don't be that person.

358
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:27,770
Let me circle back to my point.

359
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,645
I'm going to tell you
about my favorite poker

360
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:30,570
hand of all time.

361
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,710
Of every hand I've
ever played, this

362
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,800
is my favorite for
a number of reasons.

363
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
So I'm playing a tournament
in the World Series.

364
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,020
This is a big tournament.

365
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,380
And we're on the
exact money bubble.

366
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,370
And what that means is that
the next person to bust

367
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,620
out gets nothing.

368
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,360
Everyone else is guaranteed
something, couple dozen bucks.

369
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,890
I don't know.

370
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,780
So I'm sitting there, and
there's this guy at my table

371
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,640
who, as we approach
the money bubble,

372
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,120
he's so excited to be there.

373
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,390
It's his first World
Series tournament,

374
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,810
he's about to make the money.

375
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,190
He's calling his girlfriend
and his buddies every hour

376
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,720
telling them, yeah, I think
we're almost in the money.

377
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,860
He's so excited.

378
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,790
And then it gets
to the point where,

379
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,409
like, 40 minutes before
the bubble, he just leaves.

380
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:14,700
He doesn't want to play a hand.

381
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,660
He just leaves the table so
he doesn't have to bust out.

382
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,440
So he comes back.

383
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,890
And it's now the actual bubble.

384
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,200
He's to my direct left.

385
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm in the small blind,
he's in the big blind,

386
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,325
and it folds around to me.

387
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:33,200
And at this point, I
feel like there are just

388
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,790
dollar signs in my eyes, right?

389
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,670
I'm so excited.

390
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,590
So I look down and I
see four deuce off suit.

391
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,460
And we both have
medium stacks, but I

392
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,120
have this hell of a read on
this guy, so I shove all in.

393
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,650
He says, I knew you
were going to do that.

394
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,355
I call blind.

395
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,120
He calls without
looking at his cards

396
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,137
because he knew I was
going to shove in.

397
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:03,220
It's like the strongest
[INAUDIBLE] I've ever had.

398
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,210
He flips over his hand.

399
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,830
He has nine deuce off the suit.

400
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,750
He has me dominated
with a terrible hand.

401
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,710
Let's think about this.

402
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,540
How terrible does
my read have to be?

403
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,832
How far off does it have to be?

404
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:17,873
What has to happen here
for him to call with nine

405
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:18,600
deuce off suit.

406
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,730
Not only does he
have to not care

407
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,720
about bursting out,
busting out on the bubble.

408
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,790
He has to not care so
much that he won't even

409
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,770
look at his cards.

410
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,540
If he looks at his
hand, he has to fold.

411
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,809
So he proceeds to win the hand.

412
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,100
And they count us down, and
he has me literally covered

413
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,840
by one or two chips.

414
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,075
And I walk away thinking
I have to go home.

415
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,950
We rent a math house
every year out in Vegas.

416
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,040
Me and Bill Chen,
Jerrod Ankenman,

417
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,630
Mike who's sitting
right over there,

418
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,420
and a bunch of other of us.

419
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,810
I have to go home and I
have to tell these guys what

420
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,226
just-- Kenny, who's
right here-- I

421
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,260
have to tell these guys
what just happened,

422
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,300
and I still don't
hear the end of it.

423
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,786
So what does this mean?

424
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,410
So I realize the
beginning of this talk

425
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,834
sounds a little bit like
a commercial for like,

426
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,050
just be humble.

427
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,859
Don't be an idiot.

428
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,670
But I think it's a
little more than that.

429
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,329
Here's the takeaway.

430
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,800
Any time you try to divine
your opponent's strategy,

431
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,619
she can do the same
thing back to you.

432
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,990
And this happens in
really obvious ways,

433
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:30,660
like when my super tight guy
all of a sudden doesn't care.

434
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,190
But it also happens
in subtle ways, right?

435
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,100
So a lot of times we
think about pot odds.

436
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,030
So you might be
sitting there thinking,

437
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,060
OK, I'm getting two to one.

438
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,800
Do I have the best hand here
at least one in three times?

439
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,280
Very natural way
to think, right?

440
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,105
But now you're kind
of trying to do magic.

441
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:49,980
That's one of my favorite
quotes of all time,

442
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,590
by the way, from Harry Potter.

443
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,795
And the trouble is, the
other side can do magic too.

444
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:55,920
I'm trying to figure out
what their distribution is

445
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,470
and respond to it.

446
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,280
They're trying to
figure out what

447
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,220
I think their distribution
is and shape it around that.

448
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,880
And all of a sudden, we're
playing this leveling game.

449
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,140
And we're both kind of
trying to do magic, right?

450
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,512
So in the hand that I showed
you guys in the beginning,

451
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:13,970
I could be sitting
there and trying

452
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,680
to figure out exactly what
my opponent's range is

453
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,680
when she bets one and
a half times the pot.

454
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,250
I can try to figure out why
he's not putting me all in.

455
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,637
I can try to figure out a
million other little things

456
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:28,220
that are going to
help me get a little

457
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,957
more sense of this range,
but I'm trying to do magic.

458
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:34,540
And I think that's kind of our
go to move when we don't really

459
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,830
have a repertoire, right?

460
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,157
And this is going to happen
more and more-- well,

461
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:41,615
it happens with
really bad players,

462
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,448
bu that's OK-- but it's
going to happen more

463
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:44,845
and more with good players.

464
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:46,220
They'll take you
to a place where

465
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,680
they have this paved road.

466
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,140
They've been there before.

467
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,110
They take people to
these weird places.

468
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,570
And you haven't.

469
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,310
And what do you do?

470
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:03,530
So what I would say
is forget their hand.

471
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,765
Forget their range.

472
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:06,640
Don't think about it.

473
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,084
So one of my favorite people
in the world, Jerrod Ankenman,

474
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:15,500
he's the one who
wrote Bill's book

475
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,060
and let Bill put his
name on it, by the way.

476
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,430
He has this quote, "If I
truly played optimally,

477
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,860
I could write down
my entire strategy

478
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,560
on a piece of
paper, what I would

479
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,340
do in every single situation,
and I could give it to you

480
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,920
and you couldn't beat me."

481
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,080
That's what we're
trying to do here.

482
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,540
So how do we get there?

483
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,860
Well, heads-up limit hold'em
turns out to be a pretty big

484
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,360
game.

485
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,570
It has about a
quintillion game states,

486
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,590
and that's the
smallest poker game

487
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,550
that we really play for money.

488
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,570
So we can do a
couple things, right?

489
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,660
We can try to do some, like,
sweet programming like the team

490
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,422
out in Alberta did.

491
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:56,130
And that's great.

492
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,790
You know, for example,
humans play chess, right?

493
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,550
And computers now crush them,
but human learning is really

494
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,340
strongly aided by computers.

495
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,300
But you can't memorize
every position.

496
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,550
You can't memorize every line.

497
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,650
You have to know what's
going on underneath the hood.

498
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,710
And these algorithms, these
programs like Cepheus, they

499
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,380
will give you the strategy.

500
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,440
They will not tell you why.

501
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,570
And as humans, we need to
start to understand why

502
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,870
if we have any hope of carrying
these strategies with us

503
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,990
and actually playing
them in real life.

504
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,587
So they're a black box, right?

505
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:36,670
So we can solve the games.

506
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,720
But solving the games does
not get us out of the woods.

507
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,460
So if we want to wrap our
puny human minds around it,

508
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,310
we have to be a
little more clever.

509
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,340
So we're going to look at
a couple of toy games here,

510
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,880
really simple ones
that can start

511
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,620
to help us wrap our
minds around how

512
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,780
to behave in these situations.

513
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,105
So the first one is
a clairvoyance game.

514
00:20:58,105 --> 00:21:00,970
And a clairvoyance
game is basically

515
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,920
when either one or both players
have complete game state

516
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,130
information.

517
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,370
So what would you do
if you lived in a world

518
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,960
where you always knew
your opponent's hand

519
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,565
and he knew that you knew?

520
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:14,190
That's the idea of
a clairvoyance game.

521
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,344
So we're going to look at a game
called Coin Flip Clairvoyance.

522
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,510
And the game goes like this.

523
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,225
You can and should play
it for money by the way.

524
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:22,954
So each player antes a dollar.

525
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:23,870
There are two players.

526
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,911
And then you flip a coin.

527
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:26,820
If it's heads, you win.

528
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,970
If it's tails,
your opponent wins.

529
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,950
However, there's a
round of betting.

530
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,350
Only you see the
coin after the flip.

531
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,370
Then you can bet or check.

532
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,520
So you choose to bet
a dollar or check,

533
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,730
and your opponent
can only check.

534
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,340
If you check, they have
to flip over hand or call.

535
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,040
If you bet, they either have
to call a dollar or fold, OK?

536
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,382
So you know if you win or not.

537
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:53,590
Your opponent doesn't know
if they'll win a showdown.

538
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,798
That's the idea of this game.

539
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:56,650
Make sense?

540
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,780
Yeah OK, easy game.

541
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,250
So how do we play?

542
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,110
So scenario one.

543
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,860
Flip the coin.

544
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,840
It's heads.

545
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,773
What do we do?

546
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:06,715
AUDIENCE: Bet.

547
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:07,657
MATT HAWRILENKO: Bet.

548
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:08,600
OK.

549
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,700
Scenario two.

550
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,950
It's tails.

551
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,180
What do we do?

552
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,100
So there are two main questions.

553
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,720
How often should
your opponent call,

554
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,130
and how often should you bluff?

555
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,710
So how do we solve this?

556
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,700
What we want to do
is we want to call

557
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,870
enough to make your opponent
indifferent to bluffing

558
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,480
or giving up.

559
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,230
That's what your
opponent should be doing.

560
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,930
So to do that,
we're going to set

561
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,680
the expectation of bluffing
equal to the expectation

562
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,390
of giving up.

563
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,510
So the expectation of
bluffing is just this, right?

564
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,084
It's the pot times
the amount they fold,

565
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:43,000
which is one minus the
proportion of the times

566
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,040
they called, right?

567
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,290
That's how much you
win when you bluff.

568
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,400
So now how much do
you lose when you

569
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,250
bluff and get caught, right?

570
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,170
It's the amount
you bluff, which is

571
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,420
going to be one unit, times
the amount you get called.

572
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,880
So we can just sort of do
a little simple algebra,

573
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,830
and it'll reduce to-- you
should be calling p over p

574
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,030
plus 1 of the time, where
p is the pot, right?

575
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,550
So if the pot is two units
and you're bluffing one unit,

576
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,570
we should be calling with a
proportion of two over three.

577
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,260
2/3 of the time with our kings.

578
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,180
That is how we make the
opponent indifferent to bluffing

579
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,428
or giving up.

580
00:23:21,428 --> 00:23:22,640
OK?

581
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,250
So a couple of things to note
about this before we push on.

582
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,930
So what happens here
as the pot gets bigger?

583
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,294
Do you call more or less?

584
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:32,074
AUDIENCE: More

585
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:32,990
MATT HAWRILENKO: More.

586
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,469
Yeah/ So as the pot gets bigger,
this asymptotes to 1 which

587
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:37,260
makes sense, right?

588
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,884
Most of the value's
already in the pot.

589
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,780
So there's more money in there.

590
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,290
You have to protect against
being bluffed at more.

591
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,290
Totally intuitive
with poker, right?

592
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,634
So how often do you bluff?

593
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:50,300
Well, you want to set
the expected value

594
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,416
of calling equal to the
expected value of folding.

595
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,257
So the expected
value of calling here

596
00:23:55,257 --> 00:23:57,840
is just-- we're going to use the
ratio of bluffs to value bets

597
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,881
rather than a percentage.

598
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,610
It just works out nicer.

599
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,520
So the ratio of bluffs to
value bets, so how frequently

600
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,250
are you bluffing,
times the pot plus one

601
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,946
because that is what
they win when they call.

602
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:13,945
So bluffs value that times
the pot plus the unit

603
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:16,020
that you bluff.

604
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,285
And then what do they lose
when they call in their wrong?

605
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:20,910
They lose the amount
you bet, so that's

606
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,450
going to be one unit,
the value you bet.

607
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,400
So you're going
to bluff p plus 1.

608
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,480
So you're going to bluff 1
over p plus 1 of the time.

609
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,800
So now what happens here?

610
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,850
So as the pot gets bigger,
what are you doing?

611
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,880
Bluffing more or less?

612
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,004
AUDIENCE: Less.

613
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:37,920
MATT HAWRILENKO: Less.

614
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,590
Yeah.

615
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,370
Is that counterintuitive?

616
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,280
AUDIENCE: No.

617
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,640
MATT HAWRILENKO: Is it?

618
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,182
I don't know.

619
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,640
It was counterintuitive to me
because I'm like, oh, there's

620
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,560
more money in the pot.

621
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,150
But what it means is there's
more money in the pot,

622
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,270
so I don't really need to bluff
very frequently to make sure

623
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,640
I get value, because
the values in there,

624
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,180
and my opponent is
calling more of the time.

625
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,875
So the bigger the pot is, the
more my opponent calls, right?

626
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,250
And what I'm doing
essentially is

627
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,140
I'm bluffing so I can get value
from the time that I'm winning.

628
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,640
Yeah?

629
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:12,110
OK.

630
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,026
So we can actually
generalize this too, right?

631
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:16,907
So we can generalize it to
no limit games pretty simply.

632
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:18,740
So we've sort of flipped
things around here.

633
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,035
So here the pot is 1 and s
is the proportion of the pot

634
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:25,000
that you bet, so you're
going to be calling 1 over 1

635
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,050
plus s, right?

636
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:31,030
So if the pot is two
units, s is one unit,

637
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,410
so s would be 0.5, right?

638
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,570
1 plus 0.5 is one half.

639
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,140
And you'd be bluffing
s over 1 plus s, right?

640
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,230
So you're going to be calling
1 minus the bluff ratio.

641
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,105
Sometimes we call the
bluff ratio alpha.

642
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:47,270
1 minus alpha.

643
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,400
But we can actually calculate
a value for this game

644
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,830
and for all toy games.

645
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,110
So Bowling and their team
with Cepheus they calculated

646
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,550
the value of having the
button in limit hold'em.

647
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,070
We always kind of
knew it was good,

648
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,195
but they calculated precisely
just how good it was.

649
00:25:59,195 --> 00:26:01,569
And if you're looking for a
job at a place like [? Sig ?]

650
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:03,360
or somewhere else in
finance, you actually

651
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,480
probably should just
calculate the value of this,

652
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,896
because you're
going to be getting

653
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:10,100
interview questions like this.

654
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,600
So again, what we're taking
here is the larger amount

655
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,720
your opponent gets, the less
frequently you have to call.

656
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,550
Right?

657
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,040
The more frequently
your opponent bluffs,

658
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,450
the more frequently she
has to value that, right?

659
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,130
So as a bluffing
region gets larger,

660
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,707
the value betting region
has to get larger with it.

661
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:33,540
So in a coin flip game
it doesn't make sense

662
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,655
to think of regions, but
in poker it's going to.

663
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:39,280
So a question I get
here a lot is, what

664
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,700
if it's not a repeated game?

665
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,810
What if you're playing
it just this one time?

666
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,930
Or what if you're at
a table with a player

667
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,080
that you'll never
play with again?

668
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,640
How do you play that?

669
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,570
And the answer is that
it's a repeated game.

670
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,480
So I have a feeling this will
be intuitive for you guys,

671
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,160
so I'll do it quickly.

672
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,040
But I want you to
imagine a scenario

673
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,248
where you're going to play
the Coin Flip Clairvoyance

674
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,260
game a thousand times
against different players.

675
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,340
So against a thousand
different players, right?

676
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,550
And suppose you
take the position,

677
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,910
since my opponents can't
learn from my past,

678
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,710
I'm going to bluff
100% of the time.

679
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,180
So what's actually
happening here?

680
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,170
You can sort of think of each
opponent as a random sampling

681
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,089
from the distribution
of possible strategies

682
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:28,380
that are out there for the
Coin Flip Clairvoyance game.

683
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,070
So some of them will fold too
much, and you will own them.

684
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,700
And then some of them
will call too much,

685
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,900
and they will own you if you're
bluffing all of the time,

686
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,460
right?

687
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,920
So even if you haven't
seen this person before,

688
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,470
even if it's your first
hand of poker against them,

689
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,130
it is a repeated game, OK?

690
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,200
So get that, it's not a repeated
game notion out of your heads.

691
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,320
It's bad for business.

692
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,165
So taking like a
half a step back,

693
00:27:54,165 --> 00:27:55,790
what have we learned
about this so far?

694
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,420
OK.

695
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,020
So the Coin Flip Clairvoyance
game, it's not about just value

696
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,840
betting or just bluffing.

697
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,390
It's about the
combination of the two.

698
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,110
We're also trying to maximize
the value of our entire set

699
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,400
of hands, right?

700
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,620
Because what happens?

701
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,190
So suppose our
strategy is, we're

702
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,970
going to bet every
time we have heads,

703
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,020
we're never going to
bet when we have tails?

704
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,984
What's our opponent going to do?

705
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:20,150
AUDIENCE: Fold to every bet.

706
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,316
MATT HAWRILENKO: They're
going to fold to every bet.

707
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:24,240
Yeah, exactly.

708
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,230
So we sort of can
calculate this ratio

709
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,985
where now they don't do so
well if they fold to every bet.

710
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:34,360
And so what's cool about this
is the math in this game is

711
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,151
very simple, right?

712
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:35,870
It's not hard.

713
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,750
But it buys you a lot.

714
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,690
It buys you a lot of
intuition about poker.

715
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,660
Some really useful concepts.

716
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,890
So I want to move on.

717
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,310
This is probably my favorite
of all the toy games,

718
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,310
and there are actually a
million versions of it.

719
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,726
We're going to do
the simplest one

720
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:57,460
because I think it sort of
gets everything that you

721
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,914
need to know, more or less.

722
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:00,580
So this is an ace,
king, and queen game.

723
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,870
It's an incomplete
information game.

724
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,290
So each player antes $1
and is dealt one card.

725
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,820
So if I get delta
ace, my opponent

726
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,700
only has the king or the queen.

727
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,070
They can't also have an ace.

728
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,340
So then you can check of
bet and your opponent,

729
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,090
just like the Coin
Flip Clairvoyance game,

730
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:20,060
can only check or call or fold.

731
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,760
They can't bet if you check.

732
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,480
So this is going to be our
first mapping, our only mapping,

733
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,880
of a toy game that
resembles real poker, right?

734
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,960
Now we have a real range.

735
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,620
Again, I think that you
probably can and should

736
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,662
play this game for money.

737
00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:39,828
I think there's a real
difference between what we're

738
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:41,960
about to do, which is
solve it and sort of get it

739
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,570
intuitively, and actually
get it experientially.

740
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,930
So go forth and gamble.

741
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,280
But what do we do?

742
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,250
So case one.

743
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,430
So you get the ace.

744
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,443
Are you going to check or bet?

745
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:54,026
AUDIENCE: Bet.

746
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,567
MATT HAWRILENKO:
You're going to bet.

747
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:56,970
Yeah.

748
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,689
Now your opponent bets
and you have an ace.

749
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:01,730
What are you going to do?

750
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,510
AUDIENCE: Call.

751
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,093
MATT HAWRILENKO:
You're going to call.

752
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,050
All right, good.

753
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,790
And now your opponent
bets, and you have a queen.

754
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,745
What are you going to do?

755
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:08,220
AUDIENCE: Fold.

756
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,136
MATT HAWRILENKO: Yeah.

757
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:09,700
Hey, yeah.

758
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,200
OK.

759
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,690
So it seems trivial, right?

760
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,365
These first three cases
seem really trivial.

761
00:30:14,365 --> 00:30:15,740
But an important
thing to note is

762
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,430
that they are
dominant strategies

763
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,880
or dominated strategies.

764
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,570
So a dominated strategy in
game theory, for example,

765
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,325
calling with a queen
here would be dominated.

766
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,390
A dominated strategy is
one where the decision has

767
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,240
equal or lesser-- strictly
equal or lesser value

768
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,580
to another decision.

769
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,370
If I call with a
queen, I cannot win.

770
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,700
I just lose money.

771
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,450
That has strictly lesser
value than folding, OK?

772
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,360
So dominated strategies,
important concept.

773
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,540
So how about this one.

774
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,630
You have a king.

775
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,148
Check or bet?

776
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:50,945
AUDIENCE: Check.

777
00:30:50,945 --> 00:30:51,570
AUDIENCE: Check

778
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,000
MATT HAWRILENKO: Check.

779
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,666
AUDIENCE: Split.

780
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:53,710
MATT HAWRILENKO: Split?

781
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,210
OK.

782
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,599
All right, well, I actually
want to see where everyone's in.

783
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,140
So we're going to
have three options.

784
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,126
Who wants to check?

785
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:05,540
All right, who wants
to bet all the time?

786
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,090
Who wants to bet sometimes?

787
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:08,965
OK.

788
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:10,630
See, I tricked you.

789
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,420
This is also a
dominated strategy.

790
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,880
So what happens if you
have a king and you bet?

791
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,910
What is your opponent
going to do with an ace?

792
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,980
AUDIENCE: He's either
going to call with an ace

793
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,050
or fold with a queen.

794
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,091
MATT HAWRILENKO: Exactly.

795
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:24,550
Your opponent-- because
the ace and the queen,

796
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,260
dominant strategies, right?

797
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,060
Your opponents always
calling with an ace,

798
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,620
always folding a queen.

799
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,700
So betting with a king here
would be a dominated strategy.

800
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,580
Strictly dominated by checking.

801
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,730
How about here?

802
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,814
Now we have a queen.

803
00:31:40,814 --> 00:31:41,730
What do we want to do?

804
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,623
Check or bet?

805
00:31:42,623 --> 00:31:43,449
AUDIENCE: Bet.

806
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:44,990
MATT HAWRILENKO:
Check, bet, exactly.

807
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,121
We want to bet some of the time.

808
00:31:48,121 --> 00:31:48,620
Right?

809
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:52,510
And we'll go
through [INAUDIBLE].

810
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,540
And now we have a king
and our opponent bets.

811
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,584
What do we want to do?

812
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:57,560
AUDIENCE: Mix.

813
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,460
MATT HAWRILENKO: Mix.

814
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:58,959
Good.

815
00:31:58,959 --> 00:31:59,880
You got the idea.

816
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,647
Does anyone have any guess as
to how the mix might break down?

817
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:06,105
AUDIENCE: Depends
on his proportion

818
00:32:06,105 --> 00:32:09,017
of bluffing with the queen.

819
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:09,850
MATT HAWRILENKO: OK.

820
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,046
But suppose we're
trying to solve it.

821
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:14,420
So it depends on his proportions
bluffing with the queen.

822
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,400
Exactly.

823
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,940
And let's get tighter.

824
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,464
How do we solve it, right?

825
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:19,880
So if we have a
king, our opponent

826
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,550
has an ace half the time and
has a queen half the time.

827
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,510
They're going to bet all
the time with the ace

828
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,516
and sometimes with the queen.

829
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:29,000
Turns out in this
game that it's going

830
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,920
to be about the same
or exactly the same.

831
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,300
She should be calling
1 over 1 plus s, s

832
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,900
being the fraction of the pot.

833
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,670
So you should be calling with
2/3 of hands that beat a bluff.

834
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,350
So the hands that beat a bluff
are aces and kings, not queens,

835
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,850
right?

836
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,000
So if we're thinking about
it this way, before-- eh, no.

837
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,490
I'll show this first.

838
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,197
So aces are going to represent
50% of the hands that

839
00:32:59,197 --> 00:33:00,030
beat a bluff, right?

840
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,405
Because you're
going to have aces

841
00:33:01,405 --> 00:33:03,950
50% of the time and
kings 50% of the time.

842
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,140
So calling with aces seems
better than calling with kings.

843
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,260
So we're going to call
with all of our aces.

844
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,180
So now we're up to half, but
we need to get to 2/3, right?

845
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,100
We want to be calling 2/3 of the
time, kind of per our formula.

846
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,030
So we're calling
with all of our aces,

847
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,030
and then a third of
our kings times having

848
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,440
a king half the time,
that's another sixth, right?

849
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,320
So all of our aces and
a third of our kings.

850
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,800
So how is thinking
about it this way

851
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,540
different from thinking
about it using pot odds?

852
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,120
So for pot odds we're
trying to figure out,

853
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,080
what does this person
have in this situation?

854
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,310
So I'm sitting here with
a king with pot odds,

855
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:53,240
and I'm thinking, am I ahead at
least a third of the time here?

856
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,395
I don't know exactly.

857
00:33:54,395 --> 00:33:55,770
But I know that
I can try to make

858
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,110
my opponent indifferent
to bluffing or calling.

859
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,920
So I'm thinking
about what I'm doing

860
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,635
with my whole range of hands.

861
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,655
So yeah, OK.

862
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:11,030
So these are the
two observations

863
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,863
we had from the Coin
Flip Clairvoyance game.

864
00:34:12,863 --> 00:34:14,326
So adding one.

865
00:34:14,326 --> 00:34:16,909
One thing that we're noting here
with the ace, king, and queen

866
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:17,908
game, what are we doing?

867
00:34:17,908 --> 00:34:21,480
We're sort of implicitly mapping
three different types of hands.

868
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,159
Value hands, bluff
catchers, and bluffs.

869
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,710
And the big thing
here is your strategy

870
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,870
for what you do with one
hand determines your strategy

871
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,440
for other hands, all right?

872
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,010
I'm definitely
calling with the aces,

873
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,090
so I need to call with
some kings, right?

874
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm definitely
betting all my aces,

875
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,309
so I need to bluff with the
lowest-- like, the worst

876
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:46,600
part of my distribution, right?

877
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,400
That's the part that's
going to gain the most.

878
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,679
So a more subtle thing that
I think is super important

879
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,450
and is going to play into sort
of the last half of this talk

880
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,830
is if I am playing a hand
differently from you,

881
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,220
I should do different
things with other hands

882
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,450
than you should.

883
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,450
Say for whatever reason I'm
only betting half of my aces

884
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,440
but I'm still betting
a third of my kings.

885
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,480
Whoops.

886
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,370
Now I'm out of whack, right?

887
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,701
Now I'm out of balance, and I'm
going to lose more in this game

888
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:20,700
by being out of balance.

889
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,620
So your strategy for one
hand determines your strategy

890
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,480
for other hands.

891
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,450
That's the whole key here, OK?

892
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,390
So to sort of summarize
what we've done so far

893
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,390
is the Temple of Apollo.

894
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,750
This is where I'd like you
to go to see the oracle.

895
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,500
Like, you want to go
and get a prediction,

896
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,830
this is where you would go.

897
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,080
And walking into
the Temple of Apollo

898
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,875
back in the day
in ancient Greece,

899
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,380
I'm wondering if they knew a
thing or two about game theory.

900
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,421
So there are three
inscriptions above the temple.

901
00:35:50,421 --> 00:35:53,210
The first one is
know thyself, right?

902
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,660
Know your own hand.

903
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,090
Know your own distribution.

904
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,810
The second is nothing in excess.

905
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,030
Play with balance.

906
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,620
So know thyself,
nothing in excess.

907
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,390
And the last one is make a
pledge and mischief is nigh.

908
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,732
Yeah, it's really a real
stretch to make that one work,

909
00:36:12,732 --> 00:36:14,190
so we'll just leave
it at mischief.

910
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,970
Mischief can sometimes be good.

911
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,880
So let me be very clear
on how important I

912
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,310
think this concept of
knowing your own hand,

913
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,190
knowing where you are in
your own distribution is.

914
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,190
I think you should not think
about anything else in poker

915
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,380
until you have bought and paid
for a house by knowing where

916
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,170
you are in your
own distribution,

917
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,887
in shaping it to be balanced.

918
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:40,220
Don't think about anything else.

919
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,260
Everything else is
just window dressing

920
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,570
compared to this concept.

921
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,260
So here we are again.

922
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,430
So we're going to go
through this hand, the one

923
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,555
that I told you about at
the beginning of the talk,

924
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:54,429
and we're going to try
to read our own hand.

925
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:56,470
So again, we're playing
against this player who's

926
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,800
better than us,
some stuff happens,

927
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,360
what do we do on the river?

928
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,599
How do we think about that from
a game theoretic perspective?

929
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,140
So there are kind
of three ways again

930
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,550
that I alluded to
in the beginning

931
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,900
that people might
think about it, right?

932
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,240
So the first one is my
hand versus your hand, OK?

933
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,330
Well, I have aces.

934
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,510
What do I think he has?

935
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,280
King queen?

936
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,780
King 10?

937
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,765
Maybe he has queen 10?

938
00:37:17,765 --> 00:37:19,210
Maybe he's bluffing?

939
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,930
Maybe he has queen nine?

940
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,784
What is his most likely hand?

941
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:24,450
And probably as most
of you have already

942
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,540
realized-- so Kevin told me
that you'd all played at least

943
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,040
100 tournaments so
far, I'm guessing

944
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,140
some a lot more-- it's
really hard to put someone

945
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,040
on a particular hand,
not particularly useful.

946
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,620
So the next thing
you might try to do

947
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,070
is my hand versus
your distribution.

948
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:46,790
How are my aces doing
against all the hands

949
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,060
that you might have given
the actions you've taken?

950
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,850
I can't really put
you on one hand,

951
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,990
but I can look at
your actions and see

952
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:00,814
what sort of distribution
they might suggest.

953
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:02,480
And then the last one
is my distribution

954
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,070
versus your distribution.

955
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,260
And this is I can
look at your actions

956
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,080
and I can look at
my actions, and I

957
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,470
can try to shape my actions
such that they maximally

958
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,960
exploit your actions.

959
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,390
So it's not so much about
what I'm doing with my aces.

960
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,590
It's about what I'm doing with
all the hands that I'd have,

961
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,309
where I just happen
to have aces here.

962
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:26,600
And this is the style that's
most complimentary to game

963
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,900
theory.

964
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,250
So again, we're on this river
and with pot odds with my aces

965
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,410
I might be thinking, am I good
at least a third of the time

966
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,215
here?

967
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,090
But if I'm doing that
I'm trying to do magic,

968
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:42,180
because I'm trying to figure
out exactly what he has.

969
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,660
And I don't think we
need to do that here.

970
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,540
Right?

971
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,460
What I want to be thinking
is, well, how much of the time

972
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,260
do I need to call
to make my opponent

973
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,910
indifferent to bluffing?

974
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,466
Any guesses?

975
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:57,965
Yeah?

976
00:38:57,965 --> 00:39:00,290
AUDIENCE: Like 40% of the time?

977
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,230
MATT HAWRILENKO: Yeah.

978
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,980
So something like
1 over 1 plus s.

979
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,389
So how do we get there?

980
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,430
So this is the slide--
guys, if you pay attention

981
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,790
to one slide this
whole talk, this

982
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,675
is the slide to
pay attention to.

983
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:17,800
This is the slide where we
map the ace, king, queen

984
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,130
game to actual poker.

985
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,030
So the whole idea of poker
from a game theory perspective

986
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,380
is we're going to try
to make bluffing zero

987
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,510
EV for our opponents.

988
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,130
So we're going to call with
the proportion of our hands.

989
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,960
We're going to make
bluffing zero EV.

990
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,520
So in real poker, games
that allow raising,

991
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,440
that means we could
potentially be raising.

992
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,270
So we want to be
continuing 1 over 1 plus s

993
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,680
at the time, at least
calling, pondering arrays.

994
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,880
So what do we see?

995
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,970
So if this is the
ace, king, queen game,

996
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,040
we're going to map it
to real poker this way.

997
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,340
This is like our 99th percentile
hand, the very best hand we

998
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,260
can have in this spot, right?

999
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,610
So on that board there were
two kings on the board,

1000
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,945
so a 99th percentile hand would
be like quad kings, right?

1001
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:02,620
Would be four of a kind.

1002
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,086
This is our worst hand, the
very worst hand we could have

1003
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:06,211
in this spot, I don't know.

1004
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:09,170
A four deuce.

1005
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,460
And so what we're
going to do-- so again,

1006
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,120
these are the hands that are
the very best at showdown,

1007
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,020
very high EV.

1008
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,540
Very worst at
showdown, very low EV.

1009
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,770
So we're going to be
calling or raising 1 over 1

1010
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,290
plus s of the time.

1011
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,830
So the question is going to be,
what is our distribution here?

1012
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:31,520
What is 1 over 1 plus s?

1013
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,550
Our bluffed value ratio
is going to be s over 1

1014
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,380
plus s of our
worst hands, right?

1015
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,420
These are the hands that gain
the most value by bluffing,

1016
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:39,920
right?

1017
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,790
The ones that are going to
do the worst at showdown.

1018
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,422
Well, not for us in this spot.

1019
00:40:46,422 --> 00:40:47,880
I'm going to talk
about that later.

1020
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,430
Let's leave that for a second.

1021
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,960
But those are the hands that
my opponent should be bluffing,

1022
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,460
right?

1023
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,270
So if we think about
our value betting range,

1024
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,370
I might have a different
value betting range than you.

1025
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,600
And that has implications
for how we play differently

1026
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,610
than each other.

1027
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,685
So the wider my
value betting range

1028
00:41:07,685 --> 00:41:13,050
is, the more hands I
need to be bluffing.

1029
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,840
As this region expands,
this region expands.

1030
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,770
So if my opponent is
value betting more hands,

1031
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,040
they should also
be bluffing more.

1032
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,610
So when you see some of the
very best no-limit players

1033
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,230
play these guys who are just
complete animals-- you're like,

1034
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,610
how are they
bluffing that there?

1035
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,290
How are they calling that there?

1036
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,290
How are they making
this value bet so thin?

1037
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,110
This how they do it, right?

1038
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:43,380
If they're value betting a lot,
they're also bluffing a lot.

1039
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,010
So you have to call them more.

1040
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,787
So the more they bluff, the
more they have to value bet.

1041
00:41:47,787 --> 00:41:49,870
This is one of the places
where a lot of beginners

1042
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:54,110
just get way, way out of
whack, because bluffing is--

1043
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,660
it starts scary and
then it gets sexy,

1044
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,210
and then it gets
something in between.

1045
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,330
So the whole idea, don't
let this get out of whack.

1046
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:11,060
And again, the larger amount
that my opponent bets,

1047
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,520
the less frequently
I have to call.

1048
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,290
The less they bet, the more
frequently I have to call.

1049
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:19,720
So we're about to our own hand.

1050
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,450
Let's keep these couple
of things in mind.

1051
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,200
So again, I think
reading your own hand is

1052
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,700
the most important
skill in poker,

1053
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,330
and it's because what you do
with part of your distribution

1054
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,174
shapes what you do
with the rest of it.

1055
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:32,590
And so what we're about to do
is we're going to go through

1056
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,506
and we're going to sort
of make some frequency

1057
00:42:34,506 --> 00:42:37,660
updates on each street.

1058
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,320
So we're going to
do two updates.

1059
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,942
We're going to sort of update
what our hands might be given

1060
00:42:41,942 --> 00:42:43,150
the cards that have come out.

1061
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,030
So there's a card
removal effect, right?

1062
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,570
If an ace comes out,
I'm a lot less likely

1063
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,900
to have a pair of aces because
there are fewer combinations.

1064
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,540
And then we're also going
to account for the actions

1065
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,780
that we take.

1066
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,720
So let's just do it.

1067
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,350
It'll be clear.

1068
00:42:59,350 --> 00:42:59,850
So, OK.

1069
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,266
So I've opened two
off the button.

1070
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:03,369
So here's some kind
of reasonable range

1071
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:04,660
for opening two off the button.

1072
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,910
So we've gotten rid of all
the hands that aren't here.

1073
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,750
This is what I might
have right now, OK?

1074
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,940
So you don't really
need to pay attention

1075
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,360
to the specifics here, but
flop comes, king, jack, eight.

1076
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,170
So now I'm going to
update for card removal.

1077
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,469
So all the hands in
orange are the frequencies

1078
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:21,510
that have changed, right?

1079
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,424
So eights, I could
have had six of them

1080
00:43:24,424 --> 00:43:26,590
before the flop came, but
now that there's an eight,

1081
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,810
I only have three
of them, et cetera.

1082
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,080
So our total combination
down the bottom

1083
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,950
here has gone down, right?

1084
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,630
So now what happens?

1085
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,680
Well, they check, I bet.

1086
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,270
So what hands am I betting
here when my opponent checks?

1087
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,440
Well, I'm getting
rid of some of them.

1088
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,356
I don't know if they're
the right ones or not,

1089
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:49,280
but I'm getting rid of some
pairs, some bottom pairs,

1090
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,590
some gut shots.

1091
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,500
I might not be betting
those here, right?

1092
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,020
So the hands in white are all
the hands I'm still betting.

1093
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,520
And again, our frequency
is coming down.

1094
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,061
Our distribution is narrowing.

1095
00:44:02,061 --> 00:44:02,810
So the turn comes.

1096
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,350
It's a five.

1097
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,570
We get rid of some hands
with fives in them.

1098
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,756
I bet 2/3 of the pot.

1099
00:44:08,756 --> 00:44:11,130
So we get rid of all the hands
in this distribution where

1100
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,360
I'm not betting 2/3 of the pot.

1101
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,960
And really quickly,
when you're thinking

1102
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,530
about reading your
own hand-- and I'm

1103
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,320
going to say that the most
important time to be doing

1104
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,930
it is probably off the table--
when you're thinking about it,

1105
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,950
you should be really thinking
about every street, OK?

1106
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:27,450
So OK.

1107
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,870
So these are the hands
that I'm value betting.

1108
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:34,190
Turns out I'm value betting
about 94 combinations here.

1109
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,130
How's my proportion of bluffs?

1110
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,775
So I'm value betting
94 combinations.

1111
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,990
I have a total of 120.

1112
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,420
So that leaves what?

1113
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,970
26 hands.

1114
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:46,660
So how often should
I be bluffing?

1115
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,620
Or-- hm.

1116
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,330
96.

1117
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:52,354
I'm value betting 96
leaving 24 bluff hands.

1118
00:44:52,354 --> 00:44:53,770
So how often should
I be bluffing?

1119
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,590
OK, so 96 times-- what's that?

1120
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:03,900
Is it like 1 over 1 plus s, s
over 1 plus s, s over 1 plus s?

1121
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,090
So times 0.4-- that's
the amount I'm betting,

1122
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:11,060
I'm betting 40% of the
pot-- times 1 plus 0.4.

1123
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:14,930
So 96 times 0.4.

1124
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:15,610
Yeah.

1125
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,980
96 times 0.4 over 1.4.

1126
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,480
All right.

1127
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,175
So I should be bluffing
about 27 hands.

1128
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:22,800
What do I have?

1129
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,320
16, 24?

1130
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:24,860
Huh.

1131
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,526
Did pretty well.

1132
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:26,500
I'm happy with that.

1133
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,549
Pretty good shape.

1134
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:28,090
I don't know.

1135
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,030
I don't know about
all the other actions.

1136
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,863
We can argue about what
I'm checking behind,

1137
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:33,100
but we don't want
to over think it.

1138
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,020
So generally speaking, I want to
be checking in on each street.

1139
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,020
Like, ooh.

1140
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,640
Am I balanced here in the way
that I should be balanced?

1141
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,680
So the river comes a king, and
now we have fewer combinations.

1142
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,110
So what do I do with my aces?

1143
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,115
So again, s, the bet
size, he bets $1,080,000

1144
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:55,960
into a $720,000 chip pot.

1145
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,670
So s is 1.5.

1146
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,350
I should be calling
1.5 over 2.5, 40%.

1147
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,440
That's 40% of hands
that beat a bluff.

1148
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,120
So what does that look like?

1149
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,122
So if we're thinking
about our calling region,

1150
00:46:11,122 --> 00:46:13,580
what I've done here is I've
just sort of taken all my hands

1151
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:19,150
and I've ranked them, and so
kings represent my top 1%, king

1152
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,260
jack.

1153
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,085
Now we're at 9%.

1154
00:46:21,085 --> 00:46:23,585
This is like the cumulative
sort of frequency distribution

1155
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:24,460
with my hands ranked.

1156
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,490
And I'm saying here
in this distribution,

1157
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:33,660
queen jack is the worst hand
that still beats a bluff.

1158
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,130
We can argue about
that, but rough guess.

1159
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:43,800
So first nothing in excess,
calling 1 over 1 plus

1160
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,730
s of a time.

1161
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,637
Where are we?

1162
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:48,890
Ooh.

1163
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,542
This is surprising to me.

1164
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:52,560
This felt like a
tough decision, right?

1165
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,480
So we're actually at the
62nd percentile here.

1166
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:01,130
So one question is, so from
this, what should I be doing?

1167
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:03,400
Should I be calling or folding?

1168
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,180
Folding.

1169
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,540
Yeah.

1170
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,540
So it looks like I'm
calling with my king queen.

1171
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,860
I might be folding
king 10 maybe.

1172
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,010
We can talk about
that a little bit.

1173
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:14,820
But aces seem like a
pretty clear fold here.

1174
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,890
Suppose my opponent thinks that
I'll fold good hands like aces,

1175
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:24,720
and so he's like, mm.

1176
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,865
I'm going to bluff
90% of the time here.

1177
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:28,250
Is he exploiting me?

1178
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,756
Seeing head shakes.

1179
00:47:37,756 --> 00:47:39,110
He's not exploiting me, right?

1180
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:39,800
So why not?

1181
00:47:43,252 --> 00:47:43,752
Yeah?

1182
00:47:43,752 --> 00:47:46,716
AUDIENCE: Because
you win on his bluff.

1183
00:47:46,716 --> 00:47:49,383
Such a big question at the
time, it makes up for the pot

1184
00:47:49,383 --> 00:47:50,174
that you're losing.

1185
00:47:50,174 --> 00:47:51,090
MATT HAWRILENKO: Yeah.

1186
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:54,126
My distribution is really
strong here, right?

1187
00:47:54,126 --> 00:48:00,479
Of the hands that beat a bluff,
like half of them have trips.

1188
00:48:00,479 --> 00:48:01,270
That's crazy to me.

1189
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:04,800
So no.

1190
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,591
So he's not exploiting
me, but we will talk

1191
00:48:06,591 --> 00:48:09,680
about exploitation in a minute.

1192
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,830
So we solved it, right?

1193
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:12,860
So we fold aces.

1194
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,534
We even fold king 10.

1195
00:48:15,534 --> 00:48:16,950
So one question
is, do we actually

1196
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,220
want to have a
distribution in the spot

1197
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,386
where we have to fold trips?

1198
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:27,160
And if that feels kind of
bad, well, two possibilities.

1199
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,460
One it just feels
bad, or two, it

1200
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,570
might mean we sort of
screwed up on the way here.

1201
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,050
It's not the worst.

1202
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:36,000
It's not a four flush board.

1203
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,860
There are no straights
on it, right?

1204
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,050
Some folding trips here,
that feels kind of bad.

1205
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,170
So what might that mean?

1206
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,080
A couple of things, right?

1207
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,000
So one thing we could
do is I probably

1208
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,692
want a distribution where
I don't have to fold it.

1209
00:48:50,692 --> 00:48:52,650
And again, it depends a
little bit on bet size,

1210
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,714
but this is a pretty
reasonable rule of thumb

1211
00:48:54,714 --> 00:48:56,130
when you're thinking
about shaping

1212
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,630
your play off the table.

1213
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,490
So one thing that we can
do, we can add some hands

1214
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,370
in from earlier.

1215
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,100
Ooh, maybe I should have
played the turn a little bit

1216
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,600
differently.

1217
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,120
Maybe I should have
played preflop,

1218
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,203
maybe I should have played
some more hands, right?

1219
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:09,290
So we can start to
expand our range.

1220
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:10,190
Right?

1221
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,440
Now we're calling with
most all of our kings.

1222
00:49:14,944 --> 00:49:16,860
We can actually construct
a distribution where

1223
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,690
we have to call it aces, right?

1224
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,430
If we're playing way
more hands and if we're

1225
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:26,790
value betting way more hands
throughout, all of a sudden

1226
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,240
our distribution
is wider, right?

1227
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,780
And now I should be in the
same spot with the same hand

1228
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,320
and do something differently
because my strategy to get here

1229
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,830
was different.

1230
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,390
And again, that's the same idea.

1231
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,630
You see these
really good players

1232
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,980
making these crazily thin
value bets, and this is why.

1233
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,339
They're bluffing a lot
so they value bet a lot.

1234
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:52,130
The main idea that I
want you to take away,

1235
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,020
if we sort of think
of a principle,

1236
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,640
if I find myself on the river
and I have more medium strength

1237
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,810
hands, I have to call more
with medium strength hands,

1238
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,890
otherwise I can get exploited.

1239
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:06,399
Suppose we were deeper and
our opponent bets into us,

1240
00:50:06,399 --> 00:50:07,690
and we have a bunch more chips.

1241
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,080
Which hands should we be bluff
raising from this distribution?

1242
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,920
So most the time, if I'm
just straight bluffing,

1243
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,170
I want to be bluffing with the
very bottom of my distribution

1244
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:20,110
because that's the
part the gains the most

1245
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,470
when my opponent folds.

1246
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,740
If I'm bluff raising,
it's a little different.

1247
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,450
If I'm bluff raising, I
want to think about, OK,

1248
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,980
so what is the set of
hands I would fold?

1249
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,270
What are the very best hands
in that set that I would fold?

1250
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,230
And I may as well
choose those, right?

1251
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,610
Because it seems like those
hands have more value, so

1252
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,190
if I'm going to
fold them anyway,

1253
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:45,320
it's a dominated
strategy to bluff raise

1254
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,917
with hands that are
weaker than that, right?

1255
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:50,750
So if I'm bluff raising,
it should be really

1256
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,050
with the very best hands
that I would otherwise

1257
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,345
fold, not with the very
bottom of my distribution.

1258
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,060
So what do we see here?

1259
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,034
So first off, we want to check
for balance on all streets.

1260
00:51:05,034 --> 00:51:06,450
That's the big
thing we take away.

1261
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:11,050
We can argue about little
bits of distributions,

1262
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:14,280
but really, we're not solving
to the second decimal point

1263
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,060
here, right?

1264
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,800
Second, we can look
at this board all day.

1265
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,419
We can look at this king jack
eight five king board all day.

1266
00:51:23,419 --> 00:51:25,585
Unfortunately, that's not
going to be the board that

1267
00:51:25,585 --> 00:51:28,940
comes every time, and if we
just look at this board all day,

1268
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,720
we're going to start to overfit
our strategy a little bit

1269
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,040
to this board.

1270
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:40,550
So what I suggest you focus on
is fixing the glaring errors,

1271
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,400
and there will be
glaring errors, places

1272
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,730
where your distribution
is way, way imbalanced.

1273
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:50,445
I still find glaring
errors when I play poker,

1274
00:51:50,445 --> 00:51:54,540
and I've been trying to do
this for a little while now.

1275
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,370
Another thought which is not
quite so obvious from what I've

1276
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,950
said so far is, you don't
want to needlessly bifurcate

1277
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,710
your distribution.

1278
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:02,340
How do you bifurcate
your distribution?

1279
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:07,790
Well, suppose preflop,
I raise some amount

1280
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,750
with some set of hands
and in a different amount

1281
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,970
with a different set of hands.

1282
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,370
Ooh, right?

1283
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:18,730
All of a sudden I started off
here with 310 combinations,

1284
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,326
and I got down to, I don't
know, 60 or something.

1285
00:52:22,326 --> 00:52:24,700
But now all of a sudden, I'm
starting off with half that.

1286
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:29,050
I'm starting off with 155, in
this game tree gets smaller

1287
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,720
really, really quickly.

1288
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,590
So I'm not saying don't do it.

1289
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,070
But I'm saying if you do it,
A, have a really good reason

1290
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,190
for doing it.

1291
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,060
B, be really careful.

1292
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,420
Be really careful of
betting different amounts

1293
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,740
with different hand types.

1294
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,750
I basically don't.

1295
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,470
I will bet different
amounts based

1296
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:48,990
on the texture of the board.

1297
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,470
So if boards are
more [? drawy ?]

1298
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:54,590
I might tend to make my
bet sizes larger earlier.

1299
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,350
But I won't bet different
amounts with different hand

1300
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:01,700
types because I think it the
possible gain is so small

1301
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,881
and the possible loss is so big.

1302
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:08,130
And the last thing that I
found pretty cool about this

1303
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,840
was when I started
really, really spending

1304
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,490
time trying to read
my own hand, I'd

1305
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,700
start to find these
consistent situations where

1306
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,047
I would get really imbalanced.

1307
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:19,380
And then when you want to
start to think about moving on

1308
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,335
to exploitive play
after you have paid off

1309
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:24,220
a house with your
poker winnings,

1310
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:28,400
you want to maybe identify those
spots in your own opponents,

1311
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:28,910
right?

1312
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,368
If you're getting
imbalanced there,

1313
00:53:30,368 --> 00:53:35,100
other people probably are
too, so be ready for that.

1314
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:40,660
So what do I want to say here?

1315
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,950
So I guess we've ignored a
few assumptions of this model,

1316
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,180
right?

1317
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,920
The biggest assumption in a toy
game like the ace king queen

1318
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,340
game or the Coin Flip
Clairvoyance game

1319
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:54,450
is that distributions
are symmetric.

1320
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,970
If I'm applying the ace
king queen game to my river

1321
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,220
situation here, I'm
implicitly assuming

1322
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,780
that my opponents
and I essentially

1323
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,450
have an equivalent distribution
of aces, kings, and queens.

1324
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:11,010
That's not always true in poker.

1325
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:18,160
So generally I'd say that this
sort this mapping is actually

1326
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,220
fairly robust, but
at the same time,

1327
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,949
you have to be
aware of situations

1328
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:24,990
where your distributions
aren't symmetric, right?

1329
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,980
Like if you raise under the
gun at a ten handed table

1330
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,450
and the big blind
calls, your distribution

1331
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:31,600
is way, way stronger.

1332
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,520
It's not symmetric.

1333
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,730
So you're going to have a
different set of actions.

1334
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:38,360
However, as you progress
throughout the hand,

1335
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,700
distributions sort of tend to
become more and more symmetric.

1336
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,550
So generally speaking, it's
a model with some assumptions

1337
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,140
which are meh.

1338
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,650
But in my experience,
it holds pretty well.

1339
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:56,880
So another thing I
haven't talked about today

1340
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,850
is I haven't told you which
hands to value bet, right?

1341
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,800
So I've told you the
calling proportion,

1342
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,930
bluffing proportion.

1343
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,750
I haven't said anything about,
how do you choose what to bet?

1344
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,931
And there are game theory
games that can kind of give you

1345
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:09,680
insight into that.

1346
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,280
You can get insight into that
from Bill and Jared's book.

1347
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:18,890
But I think that
what's most important

1348
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:21,410
here is reading your own
hand is the thing that I

1349
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,480
think can integrate
into everybody's game.

1350
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,720
Whatever hands you currently
value bet, it can work for you.

1351
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,220
Right?

1352
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,185
And it can sort of work equally
well for the right player

1353
00:55:31,185 --> 00:55:33,440
as it can for the
very loose player.

1354
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,290
So the reason I've decided
to talk about the reading

1355
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,910
your own hand approach is this
is a very flexible approach

1356
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,380
that can work for a lot of
people in a lot of situations.

1357
00:55:44,164 --> 00:55:45,830
And, you know, as you
get better and you

1358
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:48,650
start to play more and more
hands-- or fewer and fewer,

1359
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,400
depending where you
fall on the spectrum--

1360
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,320
but generally as you start to
play more and more hands, what

1361
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,860
you're doing here, thinking
from sort of like this game

1362
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,790
theoretic perspective
is you're moving

1363
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:02,130
towards hands that are closer to
threshold hands, closer to zero

1364
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:02,860
easy.

1365
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:07,350
So adding in the nth hand
has a much smaller effect

1366
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:11,100
than adding in that,
like, fifth hand, right?

1367
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,080
Or if you think about all the
good hands in poker, right?

1368
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,027
So you're always going
to play your jacks,

1369
00:56:17,027 --> 00:56:18,860
you're always going to
play your 10s, right?

1370
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:24,350
Adding in that nine six suited
has a much smaller impact

1371
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:28,510
on your EV than adding in the
10s, the nines, the eights.

1372
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,876
Yeah, that's all I
want to say there.

1373
00:56:32,876 --> 00:56:35,000
So in the last few minutes
I'm going to talk really

1374
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,680
briefly about exploitive play.

1375
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,700
So exploitive play.

1376
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,670
So if we're looking at the top,
our best hand's at showdown,

1377
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:42,880
our worst hand's at showdown.

1378
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,171
And this is about where our
value betting threshold is.

1379
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,650
The way to exploit from a
game theoretic perspective

1380
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,780
isn't to say, ah, I
know he's bluffing!

1381
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,300
I call a blind!

1382
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,800
Although apparently that can
work pretty well sometimes.

1383
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,370
The way you do it is you
expand to the margins.

1384
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:05,210
So if normally I'm value
betting here and my opponent--

1385
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:08,180
or normally I'm calling
here and my opponent bluffs

1386
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,480
way too much, I might expand
to the marginal calls.

1387
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,516
That's one thing I might do.

1388
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:13,890
If they don't
value bet enough, I

1389
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,910
might contract the
marginal calls, right?

1390
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:21,190
But again, the ones that
are very close to zero EV,

1391
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,880
I'm never making
the big fold here.

1392
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,510
If they fold too
much, I might expand

1393
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,968
to the marginal
bluffs a little bit

1394
00:57:26,968 --> 00:57:31,100
and contract the marginal
bets a little bit.

1395
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,100
If they call too much, I'm going
to expand the marginal bets

1396
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,870
and contract the
marginal bluffs.

1397
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,370
So what that means
is you get away

1398
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:45,060
from, I think he's bluffing 80%
of the time in this situation,

1399
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,920
to-- in this exact
situation, and I'm

1400
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,590
going to catch him-- to, hm.

1401
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:52,650
This person seems
a little bluffy,

1402
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:54,600
so I'm going to
shape my distribution

1403
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,450
just a little bit around that.

1404
00:57:59,380 --> 00:57:59,880
OK.

1405
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,260
So the other idea
about exploitive play

1406
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,940
is as your read grows stronger,
as you have more confidence,

1407
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,680
you can expand to
the margins, right?

1408
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,720
So a little read, you
move the margins a little.

1409
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,460
Big read, you move
the margins more.

1410
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,520
For example, well, OK.

1411
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,360
So with our example hand, we
have a margin right about here,

1412
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,220
but we can start
to move it wider

1413
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,830
as our read grow stronger that
our opponent might be bluffing.

1414
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:32,990
But again, we don't
want to move it

1415
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:36,170
wider with just the hand that I
happen to be holding right now.

1416
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,974
We need to be thinking,
how strong is it,

1417
00:58:37,974 --> 00:58:39,640
and how wide am I
comfortable moving it?

1418
00:58:42,944 --> 00:58:45,079
Yeah.

1419
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:46,620
So if we're thinking
about exploiting

1420
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,703
with my sort of, like,
shamefully exploitive hand,

1421
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,400
what did I do?

1422
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,335
Well, it wasn't quite a 1
over 1 plus s situation.

1423
00:58:52,335 --> 00:58:53,710
We're in this
situation where I'm

1424
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:58,190
going to be shoving in the top
hands and folding the worst.

1425
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:04,410
So if my margin was here, if
my margin was, I don't know,

1426
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,410
eight six suited or
something, maybe I'd

1427
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,340
go, like, eight five suited.

1428
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:12,330
Maybe I'd go king deuce off
suit, something like that.

1429
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:14,560
Instead what I did
was I went all the way

1430
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,730
to the very bottom
of my distribution

1431
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:18,720
and got suitably punished.

1432
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:22,550
Yeah.

1433
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:26,760
So however confident you
think you are in your read,

1434
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,351
you are probably
overestimating it.

1435
00:59:29,351 --> 00:59:29,850
So, yeah.

1436
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:31,940
That's where I was.

1437
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,720
One other thought
here before I wrap up,

1438
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,510
and that's this idea of
advanced exploitive play,

1439
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:39,580
and this is fun.

1440
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,990
So we think about
expanding the margins.

1441
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,320
We think, oh, in this
spot he's bluffing.

1442
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,220
I should call more.

1443
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:50,140
But now if you start to make
slightly more subtle reads,

1444
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:55,464
this is an opponent who bluffs
a little too much on the river,

1445
00:59:55,464 --> 00:59:57,255
I could punish him on
the river by calling,

1446
00:59:57,255 --> 00:59:59,546
or this is an opponent who
folds too much on the river.

1447
00:59:59,546 --> 01:00:01,490
I could punish them,
or I could punish her

1448
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,067
by betting the river.

1449
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:04,650
But they're going
to get that feedback

1450
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:07,067
pretty soon if you're just
starting to hammer every river.

1451
01:00:07,067 --> 01:00:08,524
Another thing you
can do is you can

1452
01:00:08,524 --> 01:00:10,335
make the pot a little
bit bigger, right?

1453
01:00:10,335 --> 01:00:11,460
So don't forget about this.

1454
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,750
This is the pot.

1455
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,810
If you start making this
bigger on earlier streets,

1456
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:17,580
maybe against this
particular player,

1457
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,830
I raise a little
bit more preflop.

1458
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,570
I bet a little bit
more on the flop.

1459
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:23,070
Right?

1460
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,940
The pot's bigger on the turn,
so now I'm betting on the turn.

1461
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,910
And now with the river I
take all my normal actions

1462
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,790
except I know that I'm
winning a few too many pots

1463
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,470
because they're
folding too much,

1464
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,800
and now the few too many
parts that I'm winning

1465
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,906
are proportionally larger.

1466
01:00:37,906 --> 01:00:42,110
So this is this idea of
we can exploit downstream.

1467
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:44,232
We can anticipate
where they're weak.

1468
01:00:44,232 --> 01:00:47,660
We cannot change our play in
that spot and tip them off,

1469
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,810
but we can change it earlier.

1470
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:54,470
So to wrap up, so you
want to know yourself.

1471
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,370
You want know your
own hand, right?

1472
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:57,695
That's the first key.

1473
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,680
The second key is
to keep it balanced,

1474
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,390
and you want to
exploit the margins.

1475
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,960
And so as we think
about Cepheus,

1476
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,760
as we think about
these algorithms coming

1477
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,834
and exploiting players, so even
in 20 years, computing power--

1478
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:10,500
oh, what's that?

1479
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,680
Like 1,000 times
greater or something?

1480
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,160
Is that right?

1481
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:14,755
Wrong?

1482
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:15,880
AUDIENCE: Sounds all right.

1483
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,610
MATT HAWRILENKO: Depending.

1484
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,820
Depending if you believe
Moore's law, I guess.

1485
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,430
OK.

1486
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:23,430
So even then, even when more
poker games are tractable,

1487
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,670
you're going to need toy
games to draw insights

1488
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,450
on what's going on.

1489
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,160
As these strategies come out
of the black boxes, if you

1490
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,990
hope to grasp them, if you
hope to hold onto them,

1491
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,940
you need these kind
of insights to be

1492
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,680
able to have some scaffolding
to start to put them on.

1493
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:45,020
So I think I'm done, but if I
were to summarize this talk one

1494
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,820
way, don't be this guy.

1495
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,630
Be this guy.

1496
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:51,460
OK, we're done.

1497
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,115
Any questions?

1498
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:56,942
Ooh, wait.

1499
01:01:56,942 --> 01:01:59,400
AUDIENCE: So if you're doing,
like, Nash equilibrium, well,

1500
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,135
that guarantees
you a positive EV.

1501
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:03,173
But [INAUDIBLE]
that's always enough.

1502
01:02:03,173 --> 01:02:05,770
Like, if you're in tournament
having a positive EV,

1503
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:08,210
your chips will grow a
little but [? maybe blinds ?]

1504
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:09,910
are growing faster.

1505
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:12,139
Is that an [INAUDIBLE]
Nash equilibrium strategy,

1506
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:13,680
or do you have to
deviate if you want

1507
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,110
a higher variance [INAUDIBLE]?

1508
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,776
MATT HAWRILENKO: Yeah,
so good question.

1509
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:20,840
So the question-- and tell me--
let me make sure we answer it--

1510
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,590
the question is, OK, well, you
can try to play an equilibrium

1511
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:25,694
strategy and that's fine.

1512
01:02:25,694 --> 01:02:27,610
But if you're exploiting,
you're winning more.

1513
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,235
And so if you're
playing in tournaments

1514
01:02:29,235 --> 01:02:31,510
or these situations,
you really need

1515
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:33,240
to exploit to win more money.

1516
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,250
Is that kind of-- yeah?

1517
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,230
So yeah.

1518
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,440
That idea has been
around for a long time,

1519
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,610
and I think that
that idea is driven

1520
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:48,010
by people not really knowing
just how strong game theory

1521
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:51,170
strategies might be, and just
how strong sort of like, OK.

1522
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:53,237
So what is a Nash
equilibria here?

1523
01:02:53,237 --> 01:02:54,820
When you're playing
a Nash equilibria,

1524
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:57,403
the idea is that your opponents
are going to impale themselves

1525
01:02:57,403 --> 01:02:59,680
on their own
mistakes, and you're

1526
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,130
trying to make as few
mistakes as possible.

1527
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:06,270
And how big is that, right?

1528
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:08,220
It's kind of an
empirical question.

1529
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:13,392
In my experience, it
can be a lot bigger

1530
01:03:13,392 --> 01:03:14,350
than most people think.

1531
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,766
Because when you
start exploiting,

1532
01:03:15,766 --> 01:03:17,480
you start making mistakes.

1533
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,180
And you start sort of
getting impaled a little bit

1534
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,920
on your own mistakes too.

1535
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,150
And my guess is for most
of us, for 99% of us,

1536
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:30,840
we're going to make a lot more
mistakes than we think we do.

1537
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,510
So we think we're exploiting.

1538
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,760
At the same time we're
getting exploited.

1539
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:41,601
So actually, thinking about
that is an empirical question,

1540
01:03:41,601 --> 01:03:42,100
right?

1541
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:47,030
Like, how do human players
do right now against Cepheus?

1542
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,340
My guess is not very well.

1543
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,840
In fact, my guess
is that they're

1544
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:55,820
losing more than
the top players,

1545
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,450
the top human
players are winning

1546
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:58,960
from other human players.

1547
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,450
So that was certainly kind of
my experience a few years ago.

1548
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:06,354
So it's one of these things
where you'd see it, right?

1549
01:04:06,354 --> 01:04:07,520
Like I think-- I don't know.

1550
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,020
I feel like I saw some stat
where Cepheus was beating

1551
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:14,020
really good professionals
for four bets per hundred

1552
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,010
hands, which is a lot.

1553
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,230
Which is a lot.

1554
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,720
Like, most top players are
winning less than half of that.

1555
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,372
So Nash equilibria, yeah.

1556
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:23,080
Pretty darn good.

1557
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,804
Maybe one day when human
players are better,

1558
01:04:25,804 --> 01:04:27,220
you need to start
exploiting more.

1559
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:29,730
I don't think we're
anywhere close.

1560
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,696
Other questions?

1561
01:04:31,696 --> 01:04:34,301
Anything else?

1562
01:04:34,301 --> 01:04:35,550
All right, I guess we're done.

1563
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,049
Thanks guys.

1564
01:04:36,049 --> 01:04:38,590
I'll stick around for a little
bit if anyone wants to chat.

1565
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:41,640
