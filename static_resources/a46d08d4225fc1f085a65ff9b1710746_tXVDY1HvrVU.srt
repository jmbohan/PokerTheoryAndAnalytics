8
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:24,490
PROFESSOR: Welcome back everyone
to Poker Theory and Analytics.

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,140
We're lucky today to have a
guest speaker, Joel Freed,

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,354
coming to talk to us
about PokerTracker.

11
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:32,020
As you know, we have
a great partnership

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,440
going with PokerTracker
in this class.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,000
They sent along Joel Freed
to teach us analytics.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,290
Joel is a VIP support director
for Max Value Software, who's

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,750
the parent company
of PokerTracker.

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,490
He has taught
analytical techniques

17
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,170
to some of the biggest
names in the poker industry.

18
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,550
And he's come by to teach
us that sort of thing, also.

19
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,934
So with that, I'm going
to pass it along to Joel.

20
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:55,140
JOEL FREED: Thanks.

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,380
I hope you all have had a chance
to install PokerTracker by now.

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,770
PokerTracker is the
industry leading analysis

23
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,010
and tracking software
for online poker players.

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,569
We've been around since 2001.

25
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,340
So we've been able to grow as
the poker economy has grown.

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,340
It started out as
software only for people

27
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,450
who played limit hold 'em.

28
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,480
And it has exploded.

29
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,140
We do Omaha now-- obviously,
no-limit and pot limit

30
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,789
hold 'em.

31
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:17,080
And we have extensive tournament
support, some of which

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,690
we'll be talking about today.

33
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,150
What PokerTracker does is it can
help you identify and analyze

34
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,510
similar decision points to
help you improve your game.

35
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,870
So PokerTracker's not
going to do it all for you,

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,870
but it's going to help you find
the spots where you can improve

37
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,580
and make better decisions.

38
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,790
So what do I mean when
I say, decision point?

39
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,960
A decision point is
any time in a hand

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,760
where you can make some action.

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,840
So you can check.

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,550
You can bet.

43
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,267
You can call.

44
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:44,850
You can raise.

45
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,530
Or, you can fold.

46
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,488
At any point in the hand
where you can do that,

47
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm going to call
that a decision point.

48
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,574
And when you play poker, after
you've played for a while,

49
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:54,240
or if you've already
played for a while,

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,930
you'll realize you naturally
remember similar decision

51
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,640
points.

52
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,390
If you're the short
stack in a tournament,

53
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,230
and it's folded to you
and the small blind,

54
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,920
you're going to be able to lump
all of those kinds of decisions

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
together so that, when you face
that decision the next time

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,470
around, you already have some
kind of history to build on.

57
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,390
And using PokerTracker
to analyze

58
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,020
the interesting decision points
is really a very effective way

59
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,080
to improve your game
because, the next time you

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,320
come to a similar
decision, you will already

61
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,020
have some memory of
what you believed

62
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,870
to be right last time you were
doing something like this.

63
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,115
So what makes a decision
point interesting?

64
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,480
It's interesting when you aren't
sure what the right answer is.

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,970
And that may seem
kind of obvious.

66
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,977
But when the expectation
of the outcomes

67
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:45,435
is really close together, you're
going to sit at the table,

68
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:46,820
and you're going
to agonize over it.

69
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,730
And that's where you see
people on television, where

70
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,938
they're sitting there for
minutes, and they're going,

71
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,970
ah, I don't know what to do.

72
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,190
And those are the
interesting decision points.

73
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,600
And as you start out, you will
find that you really don't

74
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,002
know what you're doing a lot.

75
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:02,960
All decision points are
going to be interesting

76
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,490
until you start to have
some kind of heuristic,

77
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,500
some kind of rubric for
when to call, when to fold.

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,380
So here is a situation.

79
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,030
We are in the big blind.

80
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,650
It's 100/200 blinds.

81
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,250
This is a tournament.

82
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,240
In this tournament, it was
a single table tournament.

83
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
Let's say you bought in for $10.

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,510
$50 goes to first place,
$30 goes to second place,

85
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,830
and $20 goes to third place.

86
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,870
So there's four
players left here.

87
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,190
You have a chip
stack of 1,430 chips.

88
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,190
And the cutoff
here, this player,

89
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,060
opened all in for 5,700 chips.

90
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,900
The player on the button folded.

91
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,540
And this player called
for 2,980 chips.

92
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,640
So these two guys
are already all in.

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,244
You have ace, queen of clubs.

94
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:51,410
So you're ace, queen suited.

95
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,109
And you have 1,430
chips back in this spot.

96
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,275
I want you to take a second.

97
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:58,365
And I want you to think
about this decision

98
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:00,949
and, whether in this spot,
knowing nothing about these two

99
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,490
players, you don't really know
too much about them right now,

100
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,980
we'll get into that
a little bit later.

101
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,188
But without knowing anything
really about these guys,

102
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:09,500
they're just your average
players in the game,

103
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,397
would you be calling or folding?

104
00:04:11,397 --> 00:04:13,230
I want you to think
about that for a second.

105
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,740
So I'll point out
another feature here.

106
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,019
For those of you who are
familiar with pot odds.

107
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,400
Your odds here are
3.35 to 1 to call.

108
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,490
If this was a cash
game and if you

109
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,130
had 23% equity against
both of those hands,

110
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,567
you could call profitably.

111
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:33,150
Obviously, this is a tournament
situation which affects things

112
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,100
drastically right here.

113
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,810
So the total pot size is 4,810.

114
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,670
We have 1,430 to call.

115
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,720
So if you believe that this
is a very easy decision,

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,730
raise your hand.

117
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,670
One, two-- we've got a few.

118
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,170
Awesome.

119
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,410
You guys are right.

120
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,890
If you think it's a call, I
want you to raise your hand.

121
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,020
One call.

122
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,130
For the people think it's
close, if you think it's a call,

123
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,686
raise your hand.

124
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:10,870
One, two.

125
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,160
Got a few.

126
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,507
It's not even close.

127
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:15,090
And it's fold.

128
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,100
Let me talk a little bit about
what's going on in this view.

129
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,560
This is from our ICM quiz.

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,360
PokerTracker has a
feature that lets

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,000
you practice in these end of
tournament situations, which

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,550
you can access through the Tools
menu bar-- Tools, ICM, Quiz.

133
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,290
And in this spot, what it's
telling you is, if you push,

134
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,450
based on an average player
model for these two players,

135
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,190
your equity in the
tournament is 9.49%

136
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,820
based on the expectation of this
hand against these two players

137
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,450
when they're all in,
for average opponents.

138
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,180
That means that you could expect
to make $9.49 with the prize

139
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,930
we've picked out.

140
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,630
If you fold, however, you
have an expectation of 18.67%

141
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,020
And the reason for
this is that it's

142
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,369
reasonably likely that the
player with 2,980 chips

143
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,160
is going to go out.

144
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,930
And once you do that, you
are guaranteed third place.

145
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,700
So this is a clear fold.

146
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,350
It's even, in fact, a clear
fold if you have kings.

147
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,480
And you can go further in
the poker tracker ICM tool.

148
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,600
If you click the Results
link that's right here,

149
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
it will bring up the
full math, and I'm not

150
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,805
going to go through the
ICM math right now for you.

151
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,388
I know you're going
to go through that

152
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:34,300
later in the course.

153
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,700
But what you can do is you
can change their ranges, right

154
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,580
here, by clicking these buttons.

155
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,470
And so I've set
them to 100% range.

156
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,180
That means these players
are playing any two cards.

157
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,769
So even if you knew before the
hand, they pushed all in blind,

158
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,310
they didn't even
look at their hands,

159
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,480
they could have any two
cards, either one of them,

160
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,250
it's still a fold because fold
equity still is close to 19%,

161
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,730
and your push equity is
15%, even though you're

162
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:02,550
going to win half of all hands
against two random cards.

163
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,540
So before we talk
a little bit more

164
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,690
about how to use PokerTracker
to analyze your game

165
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,140
and see where you
can improve, I wanted

166
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,680
to talk a little
bit about how you

167
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,370
can use PokerTracker and not
get better poker because there's

168
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,420
some great and interesting
stuff in PokerTracker

169
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,290
that you can spend
lots of time looking

170
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:25,430
at that will not help you at
all make a better decision.

171
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,517
So looking at graphs.

172
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:29,350
People love looking at
their results graphs.

173
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,800
And here's a nice results graph.

174
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
You started off at hand one.

175
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,612
You had a nice run here.

176
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:35,070
You went steady
for a little while.

177
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,370
You won a few big hands
around hand 183,000.

178
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:45,170
And then you end up
about plus 860,000 Euros.

179
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,510
Since poker is a series
of decision points,

180
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,170
the question is, which decisions
would you make differently

181
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,010
based on this graph.

182
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,810
And the answer is
absolutely none of them.

183
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,730
Knowing that you did
this well in this spot

184
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,230
is not going to help you make
better decisions in the future.

185
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,600
It may allow you to buy a
house in the Boston area,

186
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,570
but it will not help you
actually play better poker.

187
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,130
Another way you will
not get better at poker

188
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,730
by using PokerTracker is by
looking at hands, which we call

189
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,640
walks.

190
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,150
A walk is when you're in the
big blind and everyone folds

191
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,675
to you.

192
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:20,810
You win the small
blind, which is nice.

193
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,270
But you didn't do anything.

194
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,270
There's no way in which
you could make a better

195
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,740
play in that hand.

196
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,445
And I know a lot
of heads up, sit

197
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:30,060
and go players who play
two player tournaments like

198
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,490
to look at those kinds of
spots and they want to know,

199
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,782
how much am I winning there.

200
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,240
And the answer is
it doesn't matter

201
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,721
because you can't change your
play based on who folds to you.

202
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,970
Another thing that people
want to do with PokerTracker

203
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,680
that won't help them get better
at poker is analyzing luck.

204
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,690
We have several tools
for luck in PokerTracker.

205
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,370
This graph is from
the cash game side.

206
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,050
It is actually-- you'll
notice the normal curve.

207
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,590
This is actually normalized.

208
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,900
So what you're seeing
here is each dot

209
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,850
tells you how often you're
hitting your draws relative

210
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,710
to expectations.

211
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,360
So this player is more
than one standard deviation

212
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,730
above the mean at flopping
three of a kind when

213
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,080
he holds a pocket pair,
which we call flopping a set.

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,980
And that's fantastic.

215
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,935
He's probably
making lots of money

216
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:15,060
when he has these pocket
pairs because making a set

217
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,250
is a very powerful hand.

218
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,690
However, he's not going
to be able to change

219
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,270
the way he plays by knowing
that he's been lucky in the past

220
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,930
because he may or
may not continue

221
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,300
to be lucky in the future.

222
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,740
I also have a friend who
spent lots of time building

223
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,880
lots of reports to see if he
was getting dealt aces more

224
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,770
regularly than average.

225
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,964
And while it's great
to be dealt aces

226
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:38,130
more regularly than average--
and you will make lots

227
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,713
more money if you get dealt aces
more regularly than average--

228
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,220
knowing what happened last week
will not help you the next time

229
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,160
you're sitting at
the poker table.

230
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,740
The last thing I'm going to say
about PokerTracker-- and this

231
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,680
is a little bit trickier--
there are lots of statistics,

232
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,270
and lots of numbers
in PokerTracker.

233
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,290
I think that we have easily
over 1,000 different statistics

234
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,360
you can look at, especially
when you consider combinations

235
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,970
of position.

236
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,980
And if you add stack size,
it's in the thousands for sure.

237
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,590
And the problem is, some are
not relevant to the spot you're

238
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,210
looking at.

239
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,860
And some will lack
a sufficient sample.

240
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,990
So I'm going to use
this hand to illustrate

241
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,450
both of those points.

242
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,230
This is a cash game hand
from a from real poker site

243
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,550
from about four years ago.

244
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,080
The player, hero,
here was on the button

245
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,900
and was dealt ace of
spades, 10 of hearts.

246
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,000
So he had ace, 10 off suit.

247
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,670
Before the flop,
villain16 made a raise.

248
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,070
And hero called.

249
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,940
The flop was two of
spades , four of spades,

250
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,320
three of diamonds.

251
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,040
villain16 made a bet.

252
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,210
And hero made a call.

253
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,020
I'm not going to go into whether
or not that was a good play.

254
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,070
There are reasons for it.

255
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,278
There are reasons against it.

256
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,240
But for the purposes
of this hand,

257
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,990
it's important to note
that that happened.

258
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,236
On the turn, villain16 also
bet, and hero also called.

259
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:57,110
The turn was the 10 of
diamonds and the river

260
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,040
was the ace of hearts.

261
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,637
So now, we have two pair--
top two pair in fact.

262
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:02,970
And villain16 makes another bet.

263
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,830
The bet was 1,550
British pounds.

264
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,084
And the pot was 1,975 pounds.

265
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,000
So we're sitting here.

266
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,760
We're getting 2.27 to 1 odds.

267
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,850
So if we call and we're ahead
31% of the time or more,

268
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,240
it's a good call.

269
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,130
We can fold.

270
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,980
Our stack is 3,350, so we
could also make a raise

271
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,490
to like 1,700, 1,800.

272
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,089
Now we have lots of
stats here on the table.

273
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,630
I'm not going to go
through them all.

274
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,870
This is our heads up display.

275
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,590
So we're looking, right now,
at the PokerTracker replayer.

276
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,760
The important ones to
note for this purpose

277
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,170
is this red number
here-- this 97--

278
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,960
this is the number of hands of
data we have on this player.

279
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,110
So if you were
sitting at a casino,

280
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,077
you get about 30
hands an hour, so this

281
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:48,910
would be the equivalent
of about three hours

282
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,980
of live play against somebody.

283
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,330
Online, it's more like
an hour and a half

284
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,250
because online hands tend
to come a bit faster.

285
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,870
So we've got some data.

286
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,630
It's not a huge sample.

287
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,640
VP is the VPIP number that
was talked about last time.

288
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,290
That's the percentage
of hands he's playing.

289
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,480
So he's been playing
about 2 out of 3 hands.

290
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,820
So he's been in a lot of pots.

291
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,250
So we know that about this guy.

292
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,880
And PR is Preflop Raise.

293
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,330
That's how often he's
coming in for a raise,

294
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,380
or raising at some
point in the hand.

295
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,710
And that's 45%.

296
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,910
So 2/3 of the time--
because 45 over 65

297
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,850
is 2/3, roughly--
he's making raises.

298
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,274
So he's aggressive and
he's playing lots of hands.

299
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:32,440
And here we're in this spot.

300
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,850
We're facing a big
bet on the river.

301
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,080
So we've got his river stats.

302
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,529
So if you click
on the HUD, you're

303
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,570
going to get this pop-up.

304
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,740
There's a bunch of tabs here,
Tools, Preflop, Flop, Turn,

305
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,320
River.

306
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,040
Since this is a river spot, I've
just got the River tab open.

307
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,640
I didn't want to
overwhelm you guys yet.

308
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,010
And we can see his bet stats.

309
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,090
So on the river, in
our entire sample,

310
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,160
he's had eight chances
to bet the river.

311
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,410
And he bet three
of those chances.

312
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,910
And I'm going to tell you
that that number is completely

313
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,930
and totally irrelevant
to this situation

314
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,050
because we can also see
this number for cbet.

315
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,190
Now cbet is a poker term.

316
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,890
Is called a continuation bet.

317
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,610
That means that a player has
been aggressive the entire hand

318
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,360
up till now.

319
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,260
So a cbet on the flop, he
was the last raiser preflop.

320
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,760
He gets a chance to open the
action on the flop and he does.

321
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,190
That's a flop continuation.

322
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,510
A turn continuation bet--
he made a flop cbet,

323
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,590
and he now has a chance
to bet on the turn,

324
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,460
he makes a turn bet.

325
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,560
So that's a turn cbet.

326
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,582
A river cbet is he
makes a turn cbet.

327
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:33,290
And now he has a chance
to bet the river.

328
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,070
And we have never, not
once, seen him get a chance

329
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,750
to make a river cbet.

330
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,600
So if we tried to use this
38% here, and we said,

331
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,610
well, he only bets
38% of the river,

332
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,380
so he must have a
really big hand here,

333
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,330
we would be basing it
on wrong information

334
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,200
because he could have gotten
to the river in any way

335
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
for these bets to count.

336
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,317
He could have been
calling-- a calling down

337
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:57,150
in position, and then
it was checked to him,

338
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,710
and that that would count.

339
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,780
He could've been raising.

340
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,654
He could've raised
preflop, checked the flop,

341
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:02,390
checked the turn.

342
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,098
That would count.

343
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:04,110
Any combination.

344
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,090
And his hand strength
is going to be

345
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,330
vastly different
those times he is

346
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,880
bet the entire way
than those times

347
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,610
where he's done other things.

348
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,330
So since we have a sample
of zero cbets here,

349
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,940
these river stats
are not actually

350
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,440
that useful for
analyzing this spot.

351
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,930
You're much better off
looking at the board

352
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,040
and trying to figure
out, based on his preflop

353
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,590
numbers and his flop numbers,
what kind of hand gets here.

354
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:31,830
I could talk about
this hand a lot more,

355
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,099
but that's our PowerPoint here.

356
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,390
Now we've talked about ways
that you can not get better

357
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,750
at poker using PokerTracker.

358
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,270
Let's get to the
interesting stuff.

359
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,180
How do you get better at
poker using PokerTracker 4?

360
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,910
And I'm going to say
it's a five step process.

361
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,930
Step one, use
PokerTracker for reports

362
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,420
and filters to look at very
specific kinds of decision

363
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,280
points.

364
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,470
Find those times you
find interesting.

365
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,830
Find those times where
you don't know the answer,

366
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,750
and those are the
ones we're going

367
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,749
to look-- you should be
looking at because those

368
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:03,852
are ones that are going to
help you get better at poker.

369
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:06,310
The next thing to do is create
mental models of the players

370
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,010
in a specific situation.

371
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,050
So that means you should have
an idea of what you think

372
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,140
those players are doing here.

373
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,660
Now even though they're looking
at similar kinds of decision

374
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,070
points, you're not always
going to have similar kinds

375
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,197
of players in those hands.

376
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:23,530
If you want to look at all
times you were facing a river

377
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,610
continuation bet, you're
going to have sometimes you're

378
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,568
against aggressive players
and sometimes you're

379
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:28,830
against passive players.

380
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,130
You're going to have times where
the river made a draw come in.

381
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,630
You're going to have times where
the river paired the board.

382
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,180
All these are
slightly different.

383
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,763
And not necessarily
different enough--

384
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:40,280
you wouldn't want to lump
them together for point 1,

385
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,310
but enough that you
need to definitely think

386
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,320
about the players in
this specific situation

387
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,990
and try to get an idea what's
this player doing right here.

388
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,051
This is exactly what you
would do at a live table

389
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,550
when you're sitting
across the table

390
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,549
from somebody trying to
figure out what is going

391
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:57,580
through his mind right now.

392
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,970
Then you adjust that
model that you've just

393
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,556
built based on any relevant
statistics that you

394
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:05,180
do happen to have-- if you have
notes on the player or anything

395
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,120
else.

396
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,530
If you know that this guy
lost a big hand two hands ago,

397
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,110
and he might be, what's called
in the poker world, steaming.

398
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,740
He is really mad.

399
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,390
And he is just going to be
way more aggressive right now,

400
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,250
that's relevant information.

401
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,300
If you're sitting
in a casino and you

402
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,360
know that guy has just
finished his fifth bear

403
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,300
and he's slurring his
words a little bit,

404
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,550
that's relevant information.

405
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,060
Anything that you can do to
adjust the model that you've

406
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,227
built to be more
relevant, that's good.

407
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:34,310
Then you evaluate your
different decision options.

408
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,525
So if you're in a
spot where, let's say,

409
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:37,900
you can just either
call or fold.

410
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,460
You have to think about what
kind of hand does he have.

411
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,610
Will I win if I
make a call here?

412
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,090
If I fold, obviously,
I'm out of the hand.

413
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,640
For tournaments, what chip
stack will I have remaining?

414
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,050
How does this affect
everyone else's standings

415
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:52,840
in the tournament?

416
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,430
There's a lot of considerations
for tournaments that affect,

417
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,670
especially, your
preflop decisions.

418
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,590
And then, once you've done
all four of these things,

419
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,060
go to step one and do it again.

420
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,869
Continue to do this
over and over again,

421
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,035
every time you have an
interesting kind of decision,

422
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:11,710
and you will find that you are
able to make better decisions

423
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,050
because you understand the
different decision points

424
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,040
that you're facing.

425
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,480
So let's talk about
how to navigate

426
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,207
PokerTracker 4 a little bit.

427
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,790
For those of you who
have it installed

428
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,164
and have your
computer here, feel

429
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:27,869
free to open up PokerTracker
and follow along with me.

430
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,200
So what I'm calling a
report is any kind of way

431
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,670
in which PokerTracker
is showing you data.

432
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,900
On the top left
here, this community,

433
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,500
which launches our
community page,

434
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,060
you can look at our forums.

435
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,790
You can download custom stats,
all sorts of other fun stuff.

436
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,290
Play Poker.

437
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,640
This is where you go when
you want to actually play.

438
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,430
So for those of you
who haven't actually

439
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,510
done any importing in
any of the tournaments

440
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,890
yet, when you want to
play, you go to Play Poker

441
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,520
and you click the Gets
Hands While Playing button.

442
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,530
And View Stats here,.

443
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,340
This is where all
of your information

444
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,390
is going to be displayed.

445
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,120
T is for tournament,
which is going to be

446
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,411
all you guys are interested in.

447
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:04,860
And we have four options,
Result, Statistics, My Reports,

448
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,360
and Graphs.

449
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,193
And I'm not going to
talk about Graphs today

450
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:12,100
at all just because there
really isn't enough time.

451
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,090
So there's this left
hand side bar here.

452
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,930
And some people
have liked closing

453
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,060
it to make things bigger.

454
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,870
And you should not
forget that it is there.

455
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,630
A lot of the navigation
options are in that sidebar.

456
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,730
And there is a huge
amount of value

457
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,780
in being able to change reports.

458
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,250
So right now, we're looking
at the overview report.

459
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,175
It's got a nice graph.

460
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,883
You can change different
kinds of graphs.

461
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:34,570
You can show your ROI, your ITM.

462
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,210
ROI is Return On Investment.

463
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,557
ITM is In The Money percentage.

464
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:39,140
You can show those
on this graph, too.

465
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,840
You can see your
results-- how much

466
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,670
you've won, how many
tournaments you've played.

467
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,720
And down here-- so
this is a report.

468
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,400
Right now, we're looking
at the basic By Description

469
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,230
report, which is showing
you one row per description

470
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,610
of tournament type.

471
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,220
For you guys, honestly, just
looking at By Tournament

472
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,346
is probably going to be OK.

473
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,553
That will give you one row
per individual tournament.

474
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:02,200
You're not going to
have so much data

475
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,490
that it's going to be hard
to group things together.

476
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,730
And most of your tournaments
are relatively similar.

477
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,980
If you choose Advanced rather
than Basic, all it does

478
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,840
is give you more stats.

479
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,040
So you might want to
spend some time looking

480
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,170
at what these numbers
mean in Basic before you

481
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,130
flip to Advanced.

482
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,420
And it's also important to
know-- so you can change

483
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,952
any report from this drop down.

484
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:24,910
And I'll talk about what
the different ones are

485
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,380
in a little bit.

486
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,952
But the Overview Report
has one really cool feature

487
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,910
that is not obvious, and
that is you can double

488
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,380
click to get more detail.

489
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,160
So if you want to know more
about these 392 tournaments

490
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,770
because those are
the ones you're

491
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,492
going to start playing
tomorrow and those

492
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:40,200
are the ones that are
really interesting,

493
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,450
then you double click.

494
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,120
And now you see each one
of those 392 tournaments,

495
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,602
one tournament per row.

496
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,060
And you get to see
how much you won

497
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,360
in that tournament, how
long it was, your finish

498
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,135
position, all kinds of stuff.

499
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:52,510
And it does say
here on the side,

500
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,380
double click a row
for more details.

501
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,840
And you can go back by
choosing Back By Description

502
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,190
or choosing Remove All
filters and Return to Route.

503
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,220
If that's not enough,
you can then double

504
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,100
click the individual
tournament and it

505
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,090
will show you the hands,
one hand at a time.

506
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,930
So you're going to get
a row for each hand

507
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,320
as the tournament went through.

508
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,380
It will show you most
recent 100 by default.

509
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,930
If the tournament
ran more than 100,

510
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,120
you can feel free
to change that.

511
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,790
We just have that set
so that it doesn't

512
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,690
choke too hard if you have
a 1,500 hand tournament

513
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,350
or something.

514
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,860
You can also sort by clicking
any of the column headers,

515
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,580
just like any other
reporting software.

516
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,650
So you've got one
row per line here.

517
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,350
You can also right click, which
has a lot of useful features.

518
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,900
It's a context menu.

519
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,150
And you can use that to
add or remove statistics

520
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,960
from your report.

521
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,160
So when you get into
your VPIP and your PFR

522
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,660
and those kinds of
things, you might

523
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,170
want to add or remove a bunch
of different custom stats.

524
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,750
So you can do that with
Configure Report here.

525
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,540
But you can also replay-- this
is how you'd replay hands.

526
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,480
If you want to export videos and
put them on YouTube directly,

527
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
you could just right
click, choose Export Video,

528
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,940
put it on YouTube, post
YouTube video on Facebook,

529
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,080
and everyone can see
your awesome play,

530
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,380
which is always fun.

531
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,290
And if you want to look
at multiples at a time,

532
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,847
you can use Control
or Shift-Click.

533
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:13,055
So Control-Click will
highlight one extra individual,

534
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:15,357
and Shift-Click will
highlight a range.

535
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,440
If you click here, you
hold shift, you click here,

536
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,000
it'll highlight
everything in between.

537
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,070
And then you could
say replay hand.

538
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,820
You could say replay
all hands and report.

539
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,960
And it will load everything
up in the replayer.

540
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,460
This would be the
way, if you wanted

541
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,780
to replay an entire tournament.

542
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,571
You had such a great
tournament, you really

543
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:30,910
want to watch it again,
right now, you can just

544
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,430
replay all hands and report.

545
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,970
And presto.

546
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,720
You can just click
Play and sit back.

547
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,370
And the whole tournament
will play through.

548
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,900
So another report on
the statistics side

549
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,950
that I wanted to highlight
for you is summary.

550
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,100
And the reason summary
is interesting and useful

551
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,320
is that summary allows you to
do different kinds of grouping.

552
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,640
In particular, for you, I
think starting hands hold 'em,

553
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,970
as shown here on the
right, and position

554
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,142
will be your most useful ones.

555
00:22:00,142 --> 00:22:02,100
So what happens in starting
hand hold 'em here,

556
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,000
you have one row per hand type.

557
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,180
So you can see here,
we had aces 131 times.

558
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,610
This is how many big
blinds we won, adjusted

559
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,690
for luck-- for all in equity.

560
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,450
The VPIP is 100%.

561
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,320
Congratulations, if
you did not know it,

562
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,490
you will almost
certainly, voluntarily

563
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,730
put money in the pot 100% of the
time when you get dealt aces.

564
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,500
If this number is
not 100% of the time,

565
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,890
I recommend going back and
rethinking your decision

566
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,460
process, because aces is
the best hand in Texas

567
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,630
hold 'em, for certain.

568
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,280
And nobody will say
anything else about that.

569
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,720
You can see different rows
for all the different types.

570
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,930
And that is going
to be the best way

571
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,295
to see-- if you feel
like I'm playing

572
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:43,920
some of these suited connectors
a little-- maybe it's too much.

573
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,180
Maybe I'm not sure.

574
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,200
Am I playing jack,
ten suited too much?

575
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,910
Am I playing king,
queen off suit too much?

576
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,630
If you're not sure,
come here and you

577
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,588
can start looking at the
hands because whatever

578
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:55,560
row you have here, the
hands from that row

579
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,956
will display in the bottom.

580
00:22:56,956 --> 00:22:58,830
And it works just like
the other hand report.

581
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,050
You can replay them.

582
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,170
You can double click for
more information on one.

583
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,770
They're all right here.

584
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,150
And Position and Groups.

585
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,450
I don't have an image of it, but
it groups one row for position.

586
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,970
And when I say position, I mean
if you're in the big blind,

587
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,450
if you're in the small blind,
if you're on the button.

588
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,540
So if you feel like someone
is beating up on my big blind.

589
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,670
Man, I sit there, and every
time I get my blinds raised,

590
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,605
and I have to fold,
and I hate it.

591
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:25,612
Can I play back?

592
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,820
Or am I doing it right, and
it just feels wrong to me

593
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,060
because sometimes your
memory of the situation

594
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,590
isn't really the truth.

595
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,760
You can come in and load
up the Position Report,

596
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,190
and you'll be able to see
exactly what's happening.

597
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,590
Another really awesome report
is the Hold 'em Hand Range

598
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,190
Visualizer.

599
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,570
This is in Statistics as well.

600
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,490
And it looks like a lot, but
it's not actually as crazy

601
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,410
as it looks.

602
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,740
So first off, over here, we have
various different statistics.

603
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,530
So when you choose
a statistic, you're

604
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,770
getting information based
on your values in this spot.

605
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,740
So let me talk about
what three betting is.

606
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,640
Three betting means someone
has made a first raise.

607
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,010
That's the two bet.

608
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,900
And then you made
the second raise.

609
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,937
And we're talking about
preflop only right now.

610
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:10,020
So you made the three-bet.

611
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,350
So someone raised
and you reraised.

612
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,995
That's all we know about
these hands right now.

613
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,556
But we're looking at only
those spots, right now,

614
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,180
in this report.

615
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,780
And you can look at all
kinds of different spots.

616
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,060
And this little wrench
here lets you configure.

617
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,726
If you want to put
different stats here,

618
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:26,240
you can do that, too.

619
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,710
Right now, we're
looking at range.

620
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,280
So here it says,
Range and Value.

621
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,240
So when I say range, I mean
these are the hands that you

622
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,470
have actually done this with.

623
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,530
These numbers here
are percentages.

624
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,280
And each one tells
you what percentage

625
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,170
of all of the hands that I
have made a three-bet with

626
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,520
does this comprise.

627
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,860
Let's look at pocket 10s.

628
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,760
This player made a
reraise with pocket 10s--

629
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,170
of hands he made a
reraise, 2.244% of those,

630
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,530
he had pocket 10s.

631
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,420
So you can think about this
as, if I made this raise,

632
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,292
and someone else was against me,
what could they expect to see.

633
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,750
About almost 4% of
the time, they'd

634
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,580
expect to see ace,
queen offsuit.

635
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,980
4.28% of the time, they'd
expect to see ace, king.

636
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,340
2 and 1/2% of the time, aces.

637
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,470
So this is what your
actual range looks like.

638
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,030
And in poker, we use
range as the term

639
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,850
for-- if you think of the
domain as all hole cards--

640
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,020
so those are all hole cards
you could be playing--

641
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,120
your heuristics, your mental
processes at playing poker

642
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
is the function that takes
a hand from the domain

643
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,660
and puts it in the range.

644
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,570
So this is your range.

645
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,410
You can change this
from Range to Value.

646
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,640
And this is where it gets cool.

647
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,370
This is the percentage
that this player

648
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,790
made a three bet, given
that he had a chance to

649
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,832
with each of these hands.

650
00:25:45,832 --> 00:25:48,123
And so you're going to notice
something very different,

651
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:48,690
right away.

652
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,980
We have a whole lot
of the 100s here.

653
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,870
This player has made a three
bet 100% with ace king suited,

654
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,400
ace queen suited, ace jack
suited, ace 10, and ace

655
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,180
nine suited.

656
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,120
Every time he had those
hands, and he had a chance

657
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,280
to make a reraise, he did it.

658
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,480
Every single time.

659
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,744
But if you look at the
actual percentages,

660
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:06,660
they are not the same.

661
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,789
0.84, 0.931, 1.49.

662
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:11,080
So you can tell also that he
got dealt ace, jack suited

663
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,560
in these kinds of
spots a little bit more

664
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,240
because he's still doing
it 100% of the time.

665
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,770
So this report is fantastic
for helping you figure out,

666
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:26,360
first of all, what would an
opponent be seeing me do.

667
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,000
What am I looking like?

668
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,540
And then, well, what am
I actually doing when

669
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,050
I get my hands in these spots?

670
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,170
If you think, you know what, I
should never be making reraises

671
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,532
with king, jack offsuit.

672
00:26:36,532 --> 00:26:38,240
And you come here,
and you go, well, I've

673
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,250
been doing it 75% of the time,
you immediately know something

674
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,990
that you can use next
time you have king, jack

675
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,130
offsuit in that situation
to make a different play.

676
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,580
That will let you
change your poker.

677
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,009
And again, you can pick any
of our statistics from here.

678
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:56,050
And you can look at them.

679
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,508
Anything that shows
percentage-wise

680
00:26:57,508 --> 00:26:59,840
will work in this report.

681
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,020
Another really important
report for tournament play

682
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,040
in particular is
facing preflop action.

683
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,800
So again, we're in
Statistics section,

684
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,270
and it's the Facing
Preflop Action Report.

685
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,100
What you're seeing here is
one row per kind of situation

686
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,310
that you could be in your very
first action before the flop.

687
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,430
You get dealt your cards,
stuff happens before you.

688
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,620
And now it's your
first decision.

689
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,310
Well, the question is,
what happened until then.

690
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,840
If it's an unopened pot, that
means everybody folded to you.

691
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,020
So it's a similar
kind of situation.

692
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,350
So here, we can see we
have 10,434 hands where

693
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,530
this player was the first
to be able to open the pot.

694
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,230
You can see the
winning percentage,

695
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,960
you can see their VPIP and PFRs.

696
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,200
So again, they're playing
a little more than 70%

697
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,160
of hands in that spot,
raising 60%-- a little more.

698
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,000
But you can see one limper.

699
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,824
Now a limper means someone
just called the big blind.

700
00:27:56,824 --> 00:27:57,740
It's a technical term.

701
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,200
It means there's one person
who just called the big blind.

702
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,060
And it's to them.

703
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,950
We have 1,945 hands for that.

704
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,840
You can see how
their VPIP changes.

705
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,150
Suddenly, they're not putting
in nearly as much money.

706
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,900
Part of the reason for
this is this sample

707
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,280
is based on heads up play.

708
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,910
So when you check
in the big blind,

709
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,110
it's not considered voluntarily
putting money in because you

710
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,360
haven't put any more money in.

711
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,150
And you can only
VPIP before the flop.

712
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,120
After the flop is a
totally different animal.

713
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,034
So VPIP preflop only.

714
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,700
And that's a good
thing to keep in mind.

715
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,124
So that's why you see
this kind of big drop.

716
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,290
But you can already see
how, looking at this report,

717
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,373
I can tell you something
about this player's play.

718
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:35,350
They check a lot when
it's limped to them,

719
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,142
and they're in the big
blind, and its heads up play.

720
00:28:38,142 --> 00:28:40,100
So you can use these and,
of course, this works

721
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,240
like the other reports.

722
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,990
And all of your
hands are down here.

723
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,190
And so you can
replay these hands.

724
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,680
You can do other filtering
in addition to this.

725
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,300
And it will help
you figure out what

726
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,240
your play is in different
first situation spots.

727
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,970
And tournament
play-- this is going

728
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,440
to be huge because, when you're
facing an all in before you get

729
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,270
a chance to act, your range
is going to be very different,

730
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,060
you're going to want to make
different decisions than you

731
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,840
will if everyone folds
to you because you're

732
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,110
able to steal the blinds
a lot more liberally.

733
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,250
And you're going to see,
later in the course,

734
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,070
how aggressive you
can actually be

735
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,350
as your chip stack gets small.

736
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,641
So being able to look at
these different kinds of spots

737
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:19,480
will help you fine
tune your game

738
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,610
and look at what you've actually
been doing in those situations.

739
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,560
So I've mentioned
lots of reports.

740
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,220
Do you need more than that?

741
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,140
I'm glad you do because you can
create custom reports in the My

742
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,630
Reports section.

743
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,060
In here, you can choose the
type of report, how to group

744
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,967
the report, and how to show
exactly what you want to see.

745
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,050
So any of our stats can
be added to these reports.

746
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,130
There's three kinds.

747
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,419
A player report starts
out by looking at hands

748
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:44,210
that you've played.

749
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,626
You're looking at
groups of hands.

750
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:49,030
So a stat like VPIP
looks at groups of hands

751
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,000
because it's a how
often you voluntarily

752
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,440
put money in the pot
over a sample of hands.

753
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,200
That's to contrast with a
Hand Report, which is going

754
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,840
to show you one row per hand.

755
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,259
So if you wanted to
make a report that

756
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,550
was going to show you all
hands where you faced a river

757
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,900
continuation bet, you could
do that as a hand report,

758
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,460
and save it, and load that
up really quickly next time.

759
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,304
An All Players Report,
is like a Player Report,

760
00:30:11,304 --> 00:30:12,720
except it's not
just for you, it's

761
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,100
for everybody in your database.

762
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,174
You're going to get
one row per player.

763
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:18,340
And you can put whatever
stats you want on it there.

764
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,850
For Player Report, we also have
lots of different groupings,

765
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,400
some of which you will not
see anywhere else by default

766
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,440
in PokerTracker.

767
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,980
And I want to specifically
highlight preflop stack size

768
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,030
for you guys because,
as tournament players,

769
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,260
this kind of custom
report has a lot of value

770
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,420
for you because preflop
stack size is going

771
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,280
to be the determining factor
in a lot of situations

772
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,270
in your tournament play.

773
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,140
So let's see what that
report looks like.

774
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,729
You get one row per
different stacks.

775
00:30:43,729 --> 00:30:44,770
You get different ranges.

776
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,810
These are in big blinds.

777
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,780
They're not in m.

778
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,240
You get a pretty
nice nice range.

779
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,190
And you can kind
of approximate m

780
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:58,260
by multiplying that
by 2/3 because you're

781
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,100
going to be dividing it
by the small blind, too.

782
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,600
So you can see here,
this player had

783
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,140
the stack less than two
big blinds 59 times.

784
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,825
And this is how
often they raised

785
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:07,950
when it was folded to them.

786
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,270
And you can see it's 47%.

787
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,900
So you can see, in this
spot, how someone's raising

788
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,079
range is going to change
based on their stack size.

789
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,120
And you can see we have
different samples for all

790
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,420
the different stack sizes.

791
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,360
Based on the tournaments you
guys are actually playing,

792
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,220
you're going to be seeing
numbers much more in this area,

793
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,920
and a lot less in
this area because you

794
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,420
need to be really,
really deep to be

795
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,690
able to have 100 big blinds.

796
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,481
And in the turbo
tournament, it just really

797
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:32,790
doesn't happen that much.

798
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,484
But, in addition to be
able to just look at this,

799
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:37,400
you can then come in
here to this blue Filters

800
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,450
link-- it will be blue for you
until you've clicked it once.

801
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,930
It's gray for me here.

802
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,136
And then you can make
individual filters,

803
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,760
and you can save that
with this report.

804
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,450
So you could come
in here, and you

805
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,990
could take this report,
and filter for times

806
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,920
you're facing an all in.

807
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,110
And you would then see times you
were facing an all in by stack

808
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,760
size, and see what
your stats are.

809
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,860
And you could save that.

810
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,470
And it would show
up in this dropdown.

811
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,500
And you could look at it later.

812
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,208
And you wouldn't need
to redo everything.

813
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:06,470
And it will be really helpful
for analyzing your own play.

814
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,430
So I've talked a lot about
filtering-- how do you do that.

815
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,500
This button here,
More Filters, is

816
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,220
the gateway to all of
the filtering everywhere.

817
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,100
And other than the
doing specific stuff

818
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,660
for custom reports,
this is the place

819
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,326
where you're going
to go if you want see

820
00:32:21,326 --> 00:32:23,820
specific subsets of your data.

821
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,742
So when you click it, you're
going to get this window.

822
00:32:27,742 --> 00:32:29,950
There are five sections over
here, Game Details, Hand

823
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,380
Details, Hand Values,
Board Texture,

824
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,660
and Actions and Opportunities.

825
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,630
And each one of these has
different kinds of filters.

826
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:39,660
And we tried to break it down
as intuitively as possible.

827
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,980
So Game Details is
all stuff for how

828
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,400
to filter out the game level.

829
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,670
What day did I play it on;
what currency was it in;

830
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,360
what was the speed;
was it a turbo;

831
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,430
was it as a hyper turbo;
was it a super turbo;

832
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,269
what was the buy in; what
was its description; what

833
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:56,560
was the table size; were
there six players at a table--

834
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,270
10 players at the table.

835
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,739
You can also filter for
the specific blind levels.

836
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:02,780
So if you wanted to look
at a hand at the 100/200

837
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,870
blind levels, that
would be there.

838
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,934
You navigate this by--
you choose your section

839
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:09,850
on the left hand side.

840
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,470
Anytime you see the greater
than symbol, you can click.

841
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,389
So any of these options
here, you can click.

842
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:15,930
And you'll get the
individual filters

843
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,700
you can turn on and off.

844
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,140
And I'll show you a
few of those later.

845
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,837
When you go down, you
can click up here,

846
00:33:19,837 --> 00:33:21,170
where it says cancel, right now.

847
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,092
It will change up to
the previous section.

848
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:25,800
And when you turn
everything you want on,

849
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,950
you click add to filters.

850
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,760
And then it adds
them all together.

851
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,030
Here's Hand Details.

852
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:37,720
Hand Details is filters about
the whole hand altogether.

853
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,530
So what was the maximum
preflop raise that occurred?

854
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,982
Was there a three bet at all?

855
00:33:41,982 --> 00:33:44,190
If you want all hands where
someone made a three bet,

856
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,620
you'd come here,
which can be great

857
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,510
if you want to look
at times when you made

858
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,968
a raise and someone
made a reraise,

859
00:33:49,968 --> 00:33:51,270
but you don't really care who.

860
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,800
You just want to look
at all three-bet hands.

861
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,530
You can come in here.

862
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,150
If you want to look at hands
where there was limping,

863
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,520
you can turn that on.

864
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,187
If you want to look
at hands by pot size

865
00:33:58,187 --> 00:34:00,311
or stack depth-- so you
want to look at hands where

866
00:34:00,311 --> 00:34:01,364
you had a certain m.

867
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:02,280
You can come in there.

868
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,520
How many players
were at the table.

869
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,710
If you want to look bubble
hands, you'd look there.

870
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,080
What was the position
of different players?

871
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,400
Who made the first raise?

872
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,790
Where was I sitting?

873
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,350
All that's in player position.

874
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,659
This is mostly for
custom reports and notes.

875
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,047
If you made tags
on the hand, you

876
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:19,630
can tag hands in the
right-click menu.

877
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,650
You can do that there.

878
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,199
How much you won or lost
in the hand; how much

879
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,532
you contributed to the pot;
did the hand go to showdown.

880
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:26,090
There's tons of options.

881
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,819
Hand Values is
another way you're

882
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:29,110
going to want to look at hands.

883
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,960
And that is your hole
cards, your hand strength,

884
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,949
and your draw strength.

885
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,739
So let's go through those.

886
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,210
This is what the hole
card filtering looks like.

887
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,929
You've got the chart of all the
different hole card options.

888
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:41,340
So there are several
ways you could do it.

889
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,330
If you want, you can just
click on individual hole cards.

890
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,480
So if you just wanted to
pick, say, pocket 10s,

891
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,250
you click right there, add
to filter, you're done.

892
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,429
You only see data
from pocket 10s.

893
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,715
If you wanted to see
the top 15% of hands,

894
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,090
you can come down
to this slider,

895
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,929
and you can slide
it over to 15%.

896
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,990
My top 15% of hands and your top
15% of hands may be different.

897
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,590
That's why we have
this Model option.

898
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,080
So we're using, by default,
this Glanksky-Carlson model,

899
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,120
which was invented
by them in response

900
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,620
to a very specific math problem,
which I think you guys will

901
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,880
talk about later in the course.

902
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,595
We use that as the default
model to rank hands.

903
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:18,720
But if you don't like that,
you can actually go in,

904
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,930
and you make your
own custom model.

905
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,300
You can say, you
know what, I want

906
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,341
three, two suited to be
the best hand in the deck

907
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:24,190
because I love it.

908
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,890
You can do that.

909
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,530
You can put that at the top.

910
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,100
We also have hand versus three
randoms as a default model.

911
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,690
It ranks hands based on
their equity against three

912
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,804
random sets of hole cards.

913
00:35:33,804 --> 00:35:35,220
It's going to look
very different.

914
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,524
It's going to be a lot more
skewed towards high cards.

915
00:35:37,524 --> 00:35:39,190
So you're going to
see things like king,

916
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,898
jack offsuit and queen,
jack offsuit long

917
00:35:40,898 --> 00:35:43,170
before you see low pocket pairs.

918
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,730
So that's going to make things
radically different in terms

919
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,867
of using the percentages.

920
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:48,450
There's also this
Group Select button,

921
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,336
which will save you time.

922
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:51,960
If you want to do
any ace, you can just

923
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,150
click Group Select, Any Ace.

924
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,527
Of if you wanted to do any
pair, Group Select, Any Pair.

925
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:57,110
If you want to invert
it, you can just

926
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,970
click Group Select and Invert,
and anything that's turned on

927
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,870
will be turned off.

928
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,930
So you have lots
of options there.

929
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,700
Once you set whatever you want,
you just click Add to Filter.

930
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,300
Hand Strength.

931
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,810
So once you see the flop,
you have some hand strength.

932
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,689
So all of these do imply
having some sort of hand.

933
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:12,730
Did you have a high card?

934
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,259
That means you
don't have any pair.

935
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,300
You just look at what your
high card strength is.

936
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,800
One pair, two pair,
three of a kind.

937
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,540
All the way down.

938
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,934
There are multiple, multiple,
options in each of these.

939
00:36:20,934 --> 00:36:22,600
I'm just going to
look at straight, just

940
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,239
to save a little bit of time.

941
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,530
So what you would pick is
what straight you made it on.

942
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,140
So if you wanted to
look at only times

943
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,665
you made the straight on the
river, you could pick that.

944
00:36:31,665 --> 00:36:33,082
If you wanted to
see any straight,

945
00:36:33,082 --> 00:36:34,790
if you wanted to see
all three straights,

946
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,560
you can just change
that and turn it on,

947
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,880
How many hole cards you used.

948
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,450
If you wanted both
of your hole cars

949
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,824
to be used to make
this straight,

950
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,610
you can turn that on right here.

951
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,100
A non-nut straight means it's
the best possible straight

952
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,150
versus a better
straight could be made.

953
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,840
So if you have ace, king, and
the board is queen, jack, 10,

954
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,940
you have the nut straight.

955
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,430
No one can have a
better straight.

956
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,009
You have the absolute
best straight.

957
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:57,800
If you have nine, eight
on that same board,

958
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,320
you still have a straight,
8, 9, 10, jack, queen,

959
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,480
but ace, king still is a
better straight than you.

960
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,630
So you would have
the non-nut straight.

961
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,520
Backdoor straight is when
you don't have a straight

962
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,450
until the river.

963
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,750
And you didn't have a straight
draw on the flop either.

964
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,250
So if you had ace, jack,
with a king on the board,

965
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,750
and it came queen, 10 to bust
some opponent on the bubble,

966
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,360
you just completed
a backdoor straight

967
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,670
and made somebody very unhappy.

968
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:24,920
Draw Strength.

969
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,310
So these are how you
would look at if you

970
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,537
wanted to look at my straight
draws, my flush draw.

971
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:31,120
You pick which
straight you had it on,

972
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,380
which can be any flop, turn,
or both because you never

973
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,380
have draws on the river.

974
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,910
Your hand is made or not.

975
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,910
And we have the different
kinds of draw options.

976
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,370
So for straight
draws, you can have

977
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,200
either draw to one card,
which makes you four outs,

978
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,466
or draw to two cards,
which makes you eight out.

979
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:47,340
And we let you pick here
whether the outs are

980
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,910
the best possible straight or
outs to some straight that's

981
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,770
not the best depending on
whether it's open ended

982
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,696
or double gutshot.

983
00:37:53,696 --> 00:37:56,070
Also you could filter for
backdoor straight draw or hands

984
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,870
where you didn't have
any straight draw ever.

985
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,411
So you can imagine,
these can combine

986
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,190
for lots of different things.

987
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,540
Board Texture is how the
cards are working together

988
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,580
on the flop.

989
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,747
If you wanted to look
for a flop with any ace,

990
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:11,330
you'd go into Board Cards, and
you could pick ace on the flop.

991
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,200
If you wanted to look
for the turn paired

992
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,970
the board with
the flop, you'd go

993
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,570
into board pairing to the turn
section, and that one's there.

994
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,620
If you wanted to look for times
the flop was all three clubs,

995
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,910
so you want monotone, you
would go into board suits

996
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,020
and you'd pick all three cards
of one suit for the flop.

997
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,550
Board Connectedness
is like 10, 9 ,

998
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,180
8 is considered
a connected flop.

999
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,730
10, 9, 7 is a little
less connected.

1000
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,280
So all those kinds of
options are in there.

1001
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,950
You can be really specific about
picking the situations you're

1002
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,280
filtering for.

1003
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,822
And Actions and Opportunity
is the last section.

1004
00:38:39,822 --> 00:38:41,530
But in some ways, it's
almost the biggest

1005
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,780
because these are actions you
had, or opportunities you had,

1006
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,230
in hands you played.

1007
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,860
So this includes
bets and sizing,

1008
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,250
raises, raises faced,
raise sizing, calls, folds,

1009
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,406
opportunities, you name it.

1010
00:38:53,406 --> 00:38:54,780
So we're going to
look at preflop

1011
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,454
just quickly so that
you get an idea.

1012
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:58,870
If you want to look at hands
where you voluntary put money

1013
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,370
in the pot, turn that on.

1014
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,440
Posted blinds, raises,
calls, folds, opportunities,

1015
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,769
all of these are here
to let you filter

1016
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:08,310
for times you made
a three-bet, times

1017
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,920
you faced a three-bet, times
you folded to a three-bet,

1018
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,878
times you had a chance
to face an all in-- that

1019
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:13,970
would be in opportunities.

1020
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,910
Action Sequences.

1021
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,860
Your specific action.

1022
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,030
So your first action is raising.

1023
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,155
Your second action is call.

1024
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,490
Let's bring those up.

1025
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,440
Bet Sizing.

1026
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,034
I want to look at times I made
a three big blind open raise.

1027
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:23,950
We can bring those up.

1028
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,100
Actions and Counter with Sizes.

1029
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,000
What someone else did
it and it came to me.

1030
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,040
So they made an open
raise of three big blinds

1031
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,002
and it came to me.

1032
00:39:30,002 --> 00:39:30,960
That would be in there.

1033
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,690
And we have those for
flop, turn, and river, too.

1034
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,240
If that's not enough
and you need more stuff.

1035
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,240
You can combine these.

1036
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,350
So you can highlight them.

1037
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,919
So this is what it looks like
after you click Add to Filters.

1038
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:42,710
So we've added two.

1039
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,550
Sizes calculated in big blinds.

1040
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,070
Actions faced, two-bet
preflop between two and three.

1041
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,350
So that means that someone
made a two to three

1042
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,290
big blind open before the flop.

1043
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,890
And we faced that raise.

1044
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,180
That's that filter.

1045
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,800
And this is, we made
a first raise preflop

1046
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,680
with between two and
three big blinds.

1047
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,134
Now it should be obvious, these
will never happen together.

1048
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,550
So if you leave
these on with AND,

1049
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,383
and you click save and
apply to all filters,

1050
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:09,860
you will see no data anywhere
because that can never happen.

1051
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,680
What you might want,
however, is you want

1052
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,250
to see any of these two times.

1053
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,000
So you're looking
for hands where

1054
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,440
someone made that two
to three big blind open.

1055
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,307
I want to see how that affects
things on the turn, let's say,

1056
00:40:20,307 --> 00:40:22,390
because those are the spots
I want to look at now.

1057
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,370
That's with the OR select.

1058
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,036
So you'd use OR.

1059
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:25,300
This is inclusive OR.

1060
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,800
So any of the times that match
either one of these two spots

1061
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,591
will come together.

1062
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:30,890
And when you click
that, it says OR.

1063
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,680
And you get the two
filters together.

1064
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,475
And you can also click
Ungroup, once things

1065
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:35,350
are grouped together.

1066
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,040
And you can split it back up.

1067
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,750
You can use AND if you want to
to make nested deeper logic.

1068
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,479
And NOT will negate things.

1069
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:43,270
So if you wanted to
look at-- if you wanted

1070
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,530
to negate times you made
a two-bet of that size,

1071
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,810
you could just click on
that one and click NOT.

1072
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,351
It's not highlighted
here because you

1073
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:51,760
can't NOT two things at once.

1074
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,870
And you would see all other
times, all other situations.

1075
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,490
So as you can imagine, making
a complicated situation

1076
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,964
is going to take you some time.

1077
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:03,130
And it's going to you little
work to get used to it.

1078
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,530
That's why we added this
Save As Quick Filter option.

1079
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,240
So once you've
made it, you don't

1080
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,949
have to make it again,
which is fantastic

1081
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:11,323
because if you spend half an
hour on one of these things,

1082
00:41:11,323 --> 00:41:13,880
you don't want to click Clear
Filters and never see it again.

1083
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,860
So you just click Save As Quick
Filter, and type your Quick

1084
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,050
Filter name, and click OK.

1085
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,100
And then you're done.

1086
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,780
It is now saved for the future.

1087
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,790
You will see it on a
dropdown, which I'll

1088
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,240
show you in a couple of slides.

1089
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,070
And you will just be able
to load that right up on any

1090
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,834
of your reports, instantly.

1091
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:30,250
On the other side, we have
this Edit Quick Filters button.

1092
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,920
And when you click
that, it shows

1093
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,509
any saved Quick
Filters you have.

1094
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:35,550
When you click on it, it
shows you what they are.

1095
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,572
And you can rename
them, delete them.

1096
00:41:37,572 --> 00:41:39,030
You can load them,
which is awesome

1097
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,066
when you have multiples.

1098
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:41,440
If you want to
put them together,

1099
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,210
you can load one and come over
here and load the other one.

1100
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,060
You can append them together.

1101
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,560
You can make several
pieces and then

1102
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,810
put them together really fast.

1103
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,900
We also have available for
free download on our website.

1104
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,460
Then you would import
them right here.

1105
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,350
If you wanted to export them
and give them to your friends--

1106
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,590
you said, let's all make a
group of filters together.

1107
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,824
We'll split up the sample.

1108
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:03,990
And you make these, you
make these, I'll make these,

1109
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,630
and then you want to give
them all to each other, great.

1110
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,546
You just export them,
give them to each other,

1111
00:42:07,546 --> 00:42:09,500
it saves you a
whole bunch of time.

1112
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,994
And this is the
dropdown in the sidebar.

1113
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:13,910
So you see, once we've
made this Quick Filter,

1114
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,366
you just pick it, click
that, and you're done.

1115
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:18,240
Now that filter applies
to all of the reports

1116
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,900
on the other side.

1117
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,760
So I've talked a
lot about stats.

1118
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,050
And I hope you're
sitting there wondering,

1119
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,780
what are these things.

1120
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,360
How can I find out
more about them?

1121
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,550
I want to know about it, but
there's so much going on.

1122
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,650
So the way these work is
the vast majority of stats

1123
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,990
in our software
will tell you what

1124
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,180
percentage of the time
somebody did something,

1125
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,590
given that he had a chance to.

1126
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,930
So it's this very simple
mathematical formula.

1127
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,800
How often did do
it, how often did he

1128
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,891
have a chance do it, turn
it into a percentage.

1129
00:42:47,891 --> 00:42:48,390
Done.

1130
00:42:51,892 --> 00:42:53,350
How often did he
actually three-bet

1131
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,610
divided by how often he
had a chance to three-bet.

1132
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,030
Multiply by 100.

1133
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,595
If it's 1% of the time when
he three bets, he has a hand.

1134
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,420
So let's go through
a few examples.

1135
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,304
VPIP, we've already
talked about a bunch.

1136
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:08,720
So it's the
percentage of the time

1137
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,130
a player chose to put
money in before the flop.

1138
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,450
This is considered one
of the staple stats

1139
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,617
because it really speaks
to how much a player is

1140
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:19,450
involved in the pot.

1141
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,425
If you've been sitting at
a casino and you see a guy

1142
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:24,290
that's just splashing
money every hand.

1143
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,290
He's playing every hand.

1144
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,390
He doesn't care.

1145
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,070
His VPIP is very high.

1146
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,970
And it's easier to
think about that player

1147
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,850
when you start building
models in your mind of what

1148
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,070
do players who have VPIPs do.

1149
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:39,370
And you can start to categorize
players by VPIP numbers.

1150
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,990
So someone who has
a VPIP of 40 is

1151
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,820
going to have similar kinds
of play style to someone

1152
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,464
else who has a VPIP
of 40, even if you

1153
00:43:47,464 --> 00:43:49,880
don't know a whole lot else
because this one will converge

1154
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,970
pretty quickly since
they will VPIP or not

1155
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,490
pretty much every hand.

1156
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,519
Raise First In is a little
bit more restrictive,

1157
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:58,560
but I think it's one that's
really useful for you

1158
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,950
guys in tournament play.

1159
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,370
If the percentage
of time a player

1160
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:04,290
raises on their
first action, when

1161
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,910
everyone has folded to them.

1162
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,830
So if everyone folds
to you and you raise,

1163
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,160
you raised first in the pot.

1164
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,710
So if you see that
be 40% for somebody,

1165
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,582
they are raising a ton.

1166
00:44:14,582 --> 00:44:16,290
They're raising almost
half of all hands.

1167
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,384
It's a huge number.

1168
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:19,300
And these can combine.

1169
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,424
These work together, right?

1170
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:24,290
So if someone has a VPIP of 70
and a Raise First In of two,

1171
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,860
they are calling all the time,
but they are not raising ever.

1172
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,950
So this starts to give you an
idea of what kind of player

1173
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:29,560
they are.

1174
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,150
They're the kind of
player who puts money in,

1175
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,180
but they are not willing
to commit to a raise.

1176
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,080
They don't want to
bring the stakes higher.

1177
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,990
They just want to go along
with whatever's happening.

1178
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,640
And some stats can be
super crazy specific.

1179
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,820
So we've already talked
about what three-bets are.

1180
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,730
We've already talked
about what cbets are.

1181
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,250
There is a stat in
our system called

1182
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,360
Fold To Raise After Flop Cbet
in a Three-bet or Higher Pot.

1183
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,870
That's what 3upplus means.

1184
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:51,730
Three-bet or higher.

1185
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,130
So let's break this one down.

1186
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,060
It means that we made
a three-bet or higher

1187
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:57,820
before the flop.

1188
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,460
That is, we either three-bet
or we four-bet or we fivr-bet,

1189
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,290
or we six-bet-- anything higher,
but we made the last raise

1190
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,470
because we made a
cbet on the flop.

1191
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,580
So we made some
last raise preflop

1192
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,710
that was at least a reraise.

1193
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,200
And on the flop, we
had a chance to bet,

1194
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,770
and we bet, and they raised
us-- because they raised--

1195
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:20,250
and we folded to
that specific raise.

1196
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,900
You will not see this
happening in your tournaments

1197
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,720
because you are going to
be too short to really get

1198
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,670
these situations.

1199
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,420
In a cash game, this
can be really useful,

1200
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,610
once you have a few
thousand hands on somebody.

1201
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:34,610
But as you can imagine,
if we have this,

1202
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,970
we have a lot of other
really specific stats.

1203
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,660
So if you find something
you want to know more about,

1204
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,470
you can go through
out stat list and find

1205
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,640
if there's something there
that already does it.

1206
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,326
And this is one
where you might not

1207
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,450
want to pay attention to
it until you have a really

1208
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,910
good sample size on somebody.

1209
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:52,074
So how do you find
all the stat list?

1210
00:45:52,074 --> 00:45:53,740
If you click Configure
from the menu bar

1211
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,420
and you choose
Statistics, it's going

1212
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,630
to pop open this window,
which is going to show you

1213
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,770
our entire stat list.

1214
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,020
So you guys are going to
want to change to tournament.

1215
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,710
And there are players
stats and hand

1216
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,560
stats for the different
kinds of reports.

1217
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,780
And you choose Stats here.

1218
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,952
So we're looking at
tournament player stats.

1219
00:46:07,952 --> 00:46:09,360
You could see we have this list.

1220
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,182
We're just looking at
the call stats here.

1221
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:12,390
You could see the scroll bar.

1222
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,494
So we have a lot.

1223
00:46:13,494 --> 00:46:15,160
If you want to search
for specific ones,

1224
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,743
you can just type-- if you type
three-bet in here you suddenly

1225
00:46:17,743 --> 00:46:19,160
see only three-bet stats.

1226
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,860
So we're looking at a stat
called call preflop squeeze.

1227
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,390
If you were looking through
the stats and you saw this.

1228
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,270
And you said, well,
what is that situation.

1229
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,960
Well that situation
is described here

1230
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,190
in details in the
detailed description.

1231
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,720
A squeeze is when someone has
made a raise and someone else

1232
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,720
made a call.

1233
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,530
And then, somebody
three-bets both of them.

1234
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:39,944
That projects an image
of a lot of strength.

1235
00:46:39,944 --> 00:46:41,860
This is talked about in
Harrington on Hold 'em

1236
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,400
as a great way to make a
move because if someone makes

1237
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,817
an open raise for three big
blinds and someone else calls,

1238
00:46:47,817 --> 00:46:49,566
and you're sitting
there for 10 big blinds

1239
00:46:49,566 --> 00:46:51,770
and you shovel all in,
the first player needs

1240
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,600
to decide what's the guy behind
me who called going to do,

1241
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,200
and what's this guy doing.

1242
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,750
He's got to have
a big hand if he's

1243
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,740
able to shove all
in over both of us.

1244
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,200
So that raise is
call to squeeze.

1245
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,160
If you face a squeeze,
and you call it,

1246
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,390
it will count for
this situation.

1247
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,722
If the player who made
the first raise folds,

1248
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:10,430
you still face the
squeeze if you called.

1249
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,411
So those are the two spots here.

1250
00:47:12,411 --> 00:47:14,660
And you can see, we have the
detailed description that

1251
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,340
explains exactly what it was.

1252
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:21,232
And the formula gives you
the actual numbers we used.

1253
00:47:21,232 --> 00:47:22,815
We don't say multiply
by 100 here just

1254
00:47:22,815 --> 00:47:24,149
to keep it a little bit simpler.

1255
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:25,606
We have these
detailed descriptions

1256
00:47:25,606 --> 00:47:27,160
for every stat on the list.

1257
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,830
So if you are so inclined, you
can spend several hours reading

1258
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,820
through our entire stat list.

1259
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,403
And I think you will probably
be the first person who has ever

1260
00:47:33,403 --> 00:47:35,910
actually done it besides me.

1261
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,260
So all right.

1262
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,860
We've talked a lot
about opponents

1263
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,820
and what opponent stats can be.

1264
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,050
How do you find them?

1265
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,050
How do I look at opponent
stats in PokerTracker?

1266
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,260
This is going to be
important because you

1267
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,270
need to figure out
what these numbers mean

1268
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,700
for your various opponents.

1269
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,987
So the first way is in
the results section.

1270
00:47:54,987 --> 00:47:56,320
We have a player summary report.

1271
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,980
We saw it in that
dropdown earlier.

1272
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,700
When you choose
this report, you're

1273
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,130
going to get one
row per player--

1274
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,630
and I blocked out
the players' names

1275
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,130
for confidentiality reasons.

1276
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,505
But you can then see how many
tournaments they played in,

1277
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:08,320
what their VPIP is,
what their PFR is,

1278
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,024
what their three-bet
is, how often were

1279
00:48:10,024 --> 00:48:11,190
their three-bets successful.

1280
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,210
That is how often they
three-bet and everyone

1281
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:15,580
folded to it, which is really
fun because if you have

1282
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,507
a really high
three-bet success, that

1283
00:48:17,507 --> 00:48:19,340
means you can really
three-bet with impunity

1284
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,464
because everyone's folding.

1285
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,150
And it's great.

1286
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,530
So you pick up the open
raise, you pick up the blinds,

1287
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,194
you can make lots of money.

1288
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,110
You can see this guy is
good at picking spots.

1289
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,210
He's got 64%, 65%.

1290
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,150
This guy's terrible
at picking spots.

1291
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,300
He's only been successful
one time in three.

1292
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,890
With 17 tournaments,
it's probably

1293
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,060
some number like that,
two in six, one in three.

1294
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,810
So you want to go
deeper than that?

1295
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,520
I thought you did.

1296
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,570
We've got the hero
versus villain report.

1297
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,320
And what this does is each
row again shows one player,

1298
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,240
but it specifically
targets the hands

1299
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,840
where you both put money in.

1300
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,620
So these are hands
you won money from him

1301
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,130
or he won money from you.

1302
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:56,900
It breaks down by
different sizes,

1303
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,358
so you can see if you won lots
of big hands or small hands.

1304
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:01,330
So like, we lost three
reasonable sized pots

1305
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:01,830
to this guy.

1306
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:05,720
We don't have any big losses,
which is nice in this report.

1307
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,540
We don't have any
big wins either.

1308
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,142
We took three pretty
good sized pots from him.

1309
00:49:10,142 --> 00:49:11,850
So if you highlight
one of these reports,

1310
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,310
you're going to get the
hands you were involved

1311
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,720
with this person in the bottom.

1312
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,125
So if one of your
friends has been

1313
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,750
playing in these
tournaments and saying

1314
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,140
he's been beating up on you,
you can go look in PokerTracker

1315
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,890
at the exact hands
you've played together,

1316
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:27,450
and tell him you're full of
it because here our hands,

1317
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,010
and I can see that you
did not beat me up.

1318
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,306
Look, you three-bet me
once and I had four, two.

1319
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:34,930
I'm clearly not
calling your three bet.

1320
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,820
That has nothing to do with you.

1321
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:42,160
So I'm sure you want to go
even deeper than that, right?

1322
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,330
On the sidebar, we also
have this player box.

1323
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:46,500
And you can choose a
new player, and you can

1324
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,510
choose any of your opponents.

1325
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,880
And when you load them
in here, what you're

1326
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,259
going to look at now is
all of the data in all

1327
00:49:53,259 --> 00:49:55,050
of the reports of
PokerTracker-- everything

1328
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,925
we've been talking about,
you will be looking

1329
00:49:56,925 --> 00:49:58,160
at from his perspective.

1330
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,040
So you are looking at all of
the data through his eyes.

1331
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,350
And the only thing you need
to really keep in mind when

1332
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:05,490
looking at data through
another player's eyes

1333
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:08,646
is that you only get hole card
data when he reaches showdown.

1334
00:50:08,646 --> 00:50:10,020
If he doesn't
reach showdown, you

1335
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,640
don't know what his hole cards
are because the hand's not

1336
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,520
going to tell you.

1337
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,200
But anything else, for all
hands that reach showdown,

1338
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,310
you have full information.

1339
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:23,370
You have all of our reports, all
of our stats, all the filters.

1340
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:27,220
And if that is not enough for
you, I don't know what will be.

1341
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,797
So let's look at an example.

1342
00:50:29,797 --> 00:50:31,630
We're going to look at
one example analysis.

1343
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,921
And hopefully, that will show
you how all of this stuff

1344
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:35,330
works together.

1345
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,197
Let's say, there's one situation
that was really bugging us.

1346
00:50:38,197 --> 00:50:40,030
We've been playing in
these tournaments that

1347
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:40,863
are called Fifty50s.

1348
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:43,950
Fifty50 And the way
these work is that they

1349
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,570
pay out the top 5 places.

1350
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:48,240
10 people start,
five people get paid.

1351
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,067
Once it gets down
to five players,

1352
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:51,400
everyone gets their buy in back.

1353
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,170
So if you've bought it for
$10, once you get in the top 5,

1354
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,100
you definitely
get your $10 back.

1355
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,550
And everybody who
is in the top 5

1356
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,300
has some amount of chips left.

1357
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,700
So it takes the other
half of the prize pool

1358
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,200
and gives it out
to all the players,

1359
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,640
based on how many
chips they have.

1360
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,910
So that that's how a
Fifty50 tournament works.

1361
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,450
And we want to look at
times we're in the big blind

1362
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,710
because we're been playing
a lot of these; times we

1363
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,392
were six handed.

1364
00:51:14,392 --> 00:51:15,350
So we're on the bubble.

1365
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:18,430
Once one more player goes
out, the tournament is over.

1366
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,000
That is the end
of the tournament.

1367
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,333
And we want to look at times
we have king, queen offsuit

1368
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,110
because that hand's
been bugging us.

1369
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:26,200
We don't need any
other reason, but we

1370
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,890
have a real situation here.

1371
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,370
So you go into the sidebar.

1372
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,800
You pick your Fifty50 flag.

1373
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,110
That will limit it to
Fifty50 tournaments.

1374
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:37,170
You go in to Hand Details,
Number of Players.

1375
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,740
Players dealt in a
hand, six to six.

1376
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,156
So now we're looking
at six handed

1377
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:41,750
play in Fifty50 tournaments.

1378
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,860
Actions and Opportunities,
Preflop, Post Big Blind--

1379
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,360
bang-- add that to filter.

1380
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,200
Now we're looking at big blind
play in a Fifty50 tournament

1381
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,250
six handed.

1382
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:52,950
Hand Values.

1383
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:54,840
We just turn on king, queen.

1384
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,240
That's king, queen
offsuit there.

1385
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,420
King, queen suited
is on the other side.

1386
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,140
And we go into Actions and
Opportunities, Preflop,

1387
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,369
and turn on Opportunities,
and turn on Faced All In.

1388
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:01,910
We add those.

1389
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,740
We have all of our
filters right here.

1390
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,870
And so now, we have picked
out our situation entirely.

1391
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,150
And we can look at our spot.

1392
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:12,630
We have two hands in our
database that match that.

1393
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,474
It may have felt like
you had a lot of data,

1394
00:52:14,474 --> 00:52:16,390
but sometimes, when you
go and you look at it,

1395
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,514
it turns out you don't have
as much as you thought.

1396
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:19,210
And that's OK.

1397
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,209
We're still going to look
at one of those hands.

1398
00:52:21,209 --> 00:52:22,372
We've got two hands here.

1399
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:23,580
We'll look at the second one.

1400
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,621
We're going to replay it.

1401
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:26,910
We're going to see it in
the PokerTracker replayer.

1402
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,310
So here is our spot.

1403
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,310
Let's take a moment to look at.

1404
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,390
We're in the big blind,
just like we said.

1405
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,510
We have king and a queen.

1406
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,800
Fold, fold, fold, fold.

1407
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,180
And this guy pushes all in.

1408
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,450
So we're facing our
all in from him.

1409
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:46,690
So our chip stack is 1,955.

1410
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,430
His chip stack was 725.

1411
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,610
Our blinds were 60 and 120.

1412
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,990
And there was a 15 chip ante.

1413
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:53,910
So we have 90 chips.

1414
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,230
These were from the ante here.

1415
00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:00,260
So we have to choose if we
want to call his 605 chip bet,

1416
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,500
or we want to fold to it with
king, queen here in this spot.

1417
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,060
So I want you to take
a second and think

1418
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,070
about whether you would call
here or whether you would fold.

1419
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:12,330
Remember, if you call
and you bust him,

1420
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,180
the tournament is over.

1421
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:17,610
You definitely win
money because he's out.

1422
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,390
You are in the top,
and you get more money

1423
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,300
based on your chip
stack plus your but-in.

1424
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,740
If you fold here, he
now picks up 210 chips.

1425
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,640
He now has 935 chips.

1426
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,790
He's still the short stack, and
we're going to keep playing.

1427
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,010
You have a king and a queen.

1428
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:37,070
I want you to just take a second
and think about our situation.

1429
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,770
The first thing you
should be thinking about,

1430
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:46,228
and I hope you were
thinking about,

1431
00:53:46,228 --> 00:53:48,390
right now, is what
hands would he

1432
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,950
be playing to make
this all in raise with.

1433
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,870
Obviously, he could have aces.

1434
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:55,680
Obviously, he could have kings.

1435
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,630
What other hand?

1436
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:58,860
How far down is he
going to go when

1437
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,770
he makes this all in range?

1438
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,290
And before we can make any
adjustments based on stats,

1439
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:05,920
we have to have a baseline
because if we think

1440
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,790
the baseline player is playing
all in with any two cards here,

1441
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:12,300
it's going to radically
change how we adjust based

1442
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,880
on his stats because if
he's tighter than average,

1443
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,890
tighter than average
of 100% is going

1444
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:20,630
to be very different than
tighter than average of 10%.

1445
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,840
So think about what you think
an unknown player would play.

1446
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,900
Start to build this
model in your head.

1447
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,390
This is what all the
big name pros will do.

1448
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,980
They are able to
have a baseline model

1449
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,587
and then adjust based on
individual characteristics.

1450
00:54:34,587 --> 00:54:35,420
So think about that.

1451
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,860
Think about what kinds
of hands he would play.

1452
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,596
Now let's add some stats.

1453
00:54:40,596 --> 00:54:41,970
Now we're going
to start refining

1454
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,121
our model on this player.

1455
00:54:43,121 --> 00:54:45,620
We've got a baseline idea in
our head of what kinds of hands

1456
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,660
he's going to play.

1457
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,285
Now let's look.

1458
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:48,750
We have 73 hands of data.

1459
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,010
His VPIP is 11.

1460
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,964
So in this 73 hands
that this guy's

1461
00:54:52,964 --> 00:54:55,380
been playing, so it's probably
about two tournaments worth

1462
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,850
given the length of these terms.

1463
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,690
In two tournaments'
worth, he has put money

1464
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:02,710
in 11% of the time-- 1 hand
in 9, this guy is playing.

1465
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,250
That's it.

1466
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,344
Preflop raise, 1%.

1467
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,260
And I can tell you because
I did double check.

1468
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:12,120
This means, of his 73 hands,
he raised preflop before this

1469
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,140
exactly in only one time.

1470
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,100
That's it.

1471
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,934
Only once ever.

1472
00:55:15,934 --> 00:55:17,600
In both tournaments
we've seen him play,

1473
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,850
he's only ever
raised once before.

1474
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:24,160
I hope that that changes
what hands you think this guy

1475
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,140
is going to play, at
least a little bit.

1476
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,350
Now we can look a little
bit deeper in his stats

1477
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,682
and try to see if there's
any information there.

1478
00:55:33,682 --> 00:55:35,390
Let's look at his
small blind statistics.

1479
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,572
This is the Tools pop-up here.

1480
00:55:37,572 --> 00:55:39,030
We're just looking
at the top half.

1481
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,405
There's some stuff
in the bottom,

1482
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:43,250
but it's all postflop stuff,
so it's not relevant right now.

1483
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,300
So let's just look
at small blind here.

1484
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,790
His VPIP from the
small blind is 13%.

1485
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:50,470
So one time out of eight, he put
money in from the small blind.

1486
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,720
He has never raised
from the small blind,

1487
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,470
ever, ever-- not once.

1488
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:58,890
So he did no raises of any kind.

1489
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,740
He seems to call
across all positions.

1490
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,520
So here are his callings.

1491
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,230
These are from the
preflop section.

1492
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,290
You can see he calls
from everywhere.

1493
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,190
He's called 4 out of 25 hands.

1494
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,850
He's called cold
twice, which means

1495
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,510
you call without having
put money in the pot.

1496
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,968
You can't call cold
from the blind.

1497
00:56:12,968 --> 00:56:15,570
That's why these are
going to be zeros.

1498
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:18,700
He limps behind
limpers 1 out a 7.

1499
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,230
So he's not attacking people
who just called big blind.

1500
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,900
He's not attacking people
who are acting weak.

1501
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,230
He is folding to a
blind steal twice.

1502
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:29,370
When he's in a blind,
he's perfectly happy

1503
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,780
to give his blinds up.

1504
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,150
A blind steal is when you're
in a blind and someone

1505
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,990
in the cutoff, or the
button, the last two

1506
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:37,614
positions who haven't put blind
money in-- they make a raise.

1507
00:56:37,614 --> 00:56:39,280
So when you're facing
a raise from them,

1508
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,940
it's called facing a steal.

1509
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,290
He's done that twice and
he folded both times.

1510
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:45,510
So you can start to
a piece all of this

1511
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,640
together and get an idea.

1512
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,080
But this sample is not huge.

1513
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,750
So think about what hands
this specific player

1514
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,400
is likely to raise
all in with, now

1515
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,370
that we have all of
this information.

1516
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:04,940
Remember, his tournament
life is on the line.

1517
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,780
If he is called, and he loses,
he is out of the tournament,

1518
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,800
he wins absolutely nothing.

1519
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,990
But he's the short stack.

1520
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:19,070
He has an m of about 2.7.

1521
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:21,521
He could go less than three
orbits before he is completely

1522
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,770
out of chips, just by folding.

1523
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,510
So he has to make a
move at some point.

1524
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,965
He has to pick a hand
and make a stand soon.

1525
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:29,090
So the fact that his
tournament life is on the line

1526
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:31,460
is going to make him
tighter because he doesn't

1527
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,660
want to lose the tournament.

1528
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,910
The fact that he is so
short with such a short m,

1529
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,300
is going to make him looser.

1530
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,550
So these kind of are in
conflict with one another.

1531
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:39,925
And as you play
more tournaments,

1532
00:57:39,925 --> 00:57:43,070
you're going to find
out how they poll.

1533
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:46,990
Do you think this guy is going
to play low pocket pairs?

1534
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:49,100
Do you think he's going
to pick deuces here,

1535
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,200
and happy to play a coin
flipper for his tournament life?

1536
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,620
I see one person
shaking his head.

1537
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,720
What about weak aces?

1538
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,470
Do you think ace,
four offsuit is OK?

1539
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:00,750
Do you think he's willing
to take his tournament

1540
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:04,952
life into his hands with
just a really weak ace?

1541
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:05,910
What about king, queen.

1542
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,284
Could we have the
same hand here?

1543
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:09,200
Would he make this
shove with my hand?

1544
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,000
King, 10?

1545
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,890
Could we have him
completely dominated?

1546
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,560
So that's another poker term.

1547
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,270
If you have the same
card and your other card

1548
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:19,330
is better than theirs,
it's called dominating.

1549
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:22,920
You're 70 to 30 favorite in
that spot-- something like that.

1550
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,560
A queen, jack-- same
kind of situation.

1551
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,230
If he's willing to do
it with these hands,

1552
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,540
then we're in a really
great spot, right?

1553
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:36,690
We have to decide what this
player would open raise with.

1554
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:39,390
So now we're starting
to build that model.

1555
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:44,380
Remember, his VPIP is 11%,
so let's start-- first,

1556
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,970
if you want to convert
percentages to actual hands,

1557
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:50,680
the equity calculator
in PokerTracker

1558
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,150
will help you with
this because it's

1559
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:55,631
kind of hard to know
what 11% of hands is.

1560
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:57,630
Especially if you don't
have experience with it,

1561
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,160
you're like, I don't know.

1562
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,020
So you can come into
the equity calculator.

1563
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,485
And you can pop that open.

1564
00:59:03,485 --> 00:59:05,110
And you can choose
Hand Range Selector.

1565
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,776
And then you can use
the slider, and you

1566
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,070
can see what the model says.

1567
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:09,653
Again, we're still
in Glansky-Carlson.

1568
00:59:09,653 --> 00:59:11,760
You can play between the models.

1569
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,090
So this is 15%.

1570
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,230
So think about the
hands that you've just

1571
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,530
decided this guy's
willing to go all in with.

1572
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:22,210
Here's a 15% range according
to Glansky-Carlson.

1573
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,161
Wider.

1574
00:59:23,161 --> 00:59:23,660
Looser.

1575
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:30,180
So this guys is down to ace,
four suitedl down to king,

1576
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,280
10 suited; pairs, down to three
not twos; and down to ace,

1577
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,570
eight. that's 15% of all hands.

1578
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:41,210
Well, we said he'll play 11% of
hands, overall over 73 hands.

1579
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:45,660
So let's start by saying,
any hand in the top 11%.

1580
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,762
He'll play those.

1581
00:59:46,762 --> 00:59:47,970
It's not going to be perfect.

1582
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:49,607
Our sample's not fantastic.

1583
00:59:49,607 --> 00:59:51,940
We know this, but we're trying
to get an idea for what's

1584
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,000
right to do here in the spot.

1585
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,480
So this is the top 11%.

1586
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,070
You don't have the
bottom two pairs.

1587
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,770
You don't have any
weak aces at all.

1588
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,780
Even ace, nine is
considered a middling ace.

1589
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,320
So that's not too bad.

1590
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,520
He has no weak suited aces.

1591
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,892
That's a 11% range.

1592
01:00:06,892 --> 01:00:08,100
That's a pretty strong range.

1593
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:15,180
So PokerTracker also has a built
in calculator that does ICM.

1594
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:18,610
ICM stands for the
Independent Chip Model.

1595
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,640
This has been out there
for a little while.

1596
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,260
And what the ICM does is
it takes tournament chips

1597
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,352
and converts them to
real world dollars

1598
01:00:27,352 --> 01:00:29,310
because tournament chips
and real world dollars

1599
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:31,661
don't have a one
to one correlation

1600
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,160
because your last
tournament chip is

1601
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,400
worth a lot more than
your thousandth tournament

1602
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,230
chip, if you have 1,000 chip
stack-- because once you're

1603
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,450
out, you can win nothing.

1604
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:41,840
But that extra chip
doesn't mean quite as much.

1605
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,610
So this model takes your
equity, your total chip stack,

1606
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,900
and gives you a result as
an equity in the prize pool.

1607
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,790
It says, with this chip
stack, if everything

1608
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:54,391
were even-- ceteris paribus--
nothing else to be considered,

1609
01:00:54,391 --> 01:00:56,140
this is what your
equity in the prize pool

1610
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,880
should be according
to the model.

1611
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,330
This has been there in the
replayer the entire time.

1612
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,810
I don't know if you noticed
it, but if you click it,

1613
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:06,067
it will show you the
results in this spot.

1614
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:08,650
So we're going to be looking at
the times we face this all in,

1615
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:11,990
and we will see what
the average model says

1616
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:17,280
whether we should push or fold
in this spot with this hand.

1617
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,070
So who thinks we should
call his all in raise,

1618
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:22,380
if he was an average player?

1619
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,630
Everyone else I
presume says fold.

1620
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:31,860
The default model says call.

1621
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,237
Everyone who raised
your hand, you guys win.

1622
01:01:34,237 --> 01:01:36,070
So you can click the
blue results link here,

1623
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,440
you can see the full ICM tree.

1624
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,160
But the important
thing to note right now

1625
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,000
is you can look and see
what your prize pool

1626
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,916
equity is, right here.

1627
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:44,320
If you push, you can
say you would have,

1628
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,310
against the average model,
a 15.83% equity in the prize

1629
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,070
pool.

1630
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:50,930
If you fold, 15.28%.

1631
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,470
Now keep in mind, this is just
against the average model.

1632
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:56,270
This is not based
on anything we've

1633
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,410
done specifically to
analyze this player.

1634
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,950
But the good news is,
we can change that.

1635
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,700
And we can see what
the model's range was.

1636
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,241
So when we click
results, we're going

1637
01:02:04,241 --> 01:02:07,460
to see what the model says the
average player would raise all

1638
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:10,030
in with in this spot.

1639
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:19,880
And the default range is--
drum roll, please-- 33.9%.

1640
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,920
The default model says
the average player

1641
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,355
will raise all in
with an m of 2.7,

1642
01:02:24,355 --> 01:02:29,020
when folded to in the small
blind with about 34% of hands.

1643
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:33,630
We built this model using some
pretty robust data analysis.

1644
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,890
But as we've seen, different
players play very differently.

1645
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:40,100
And this player is most
certainly not average

1646
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,802
because we put him on somewhere
much tighter than 33.9%.

1647
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,510
And you can see push
equity here and fold

1648
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:46,820
equity or not that different.

1649
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:49,130
We're only talking
0.6% of the prize pool.

1650
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:50,680
So if we're playing
a $10 tournament,

1651
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,170
we're talking about the
difference between an expected

1652
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,180
result of $0.60.

1653
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,550
It's not huge, but each
little edge in poker

1654
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:00,410
adds up, one piece right
on top of the other.

1655
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,410
And making these decisions
in the marginal spots

1656
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,690
is really how you can
expand your advantage

1657
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:06,740
and play better
than your opponents.

1658
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:07,795
So let's change that.

1659
01:03:07,795 --> 01:03:09,670
So you can click right
here, once you've been

1660
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:11,740
looking at the model results.

1661
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,250
You can change his range.

1662
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:16,540
So this, by the way,
is what 33% looks like.

1663
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,760
So the average player here
shoving as weak as queen,

1664
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,450
eight suited; king, two
suited; king, six offsuit;

1665
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,060
any pair; any ace.

1666
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,690
That's a lot of hands.

1667
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:29,930
These are weak, weak hands.

1668
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:30,660
So we change it.

1669
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,430
We'll drag the slider down
from 33.8% down to 11%.

1670
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:37,250
Suddenly, now we're looking
at a whole lot tighter range.

1671
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:41,615
With the updated range,
who thinks it's a call now?

1672
01:03:41,615 --> 01:03:43,740
Good, I'm glad nobody thinks
it's a call because it

1673
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,500
is in fact, a fold.

1674
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,970
So by looking at this
player, by doing analysis

1675
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:52,320
of his previous play, we were
able to turn a close call

1676
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,260
into a close fold.

1677
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:57,250
And so in this spot,
when he has this range,

1678
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:01,910
our push equity is 14.85% and
fold equity is 15 and 1/4%.

1679
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,850
And you can actually
play with this.

1680
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,910
And you can keep changing
and updating the range.

1681
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,700
And you can figure out
what break even is.

1682
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,767
So if he knew what
our cards, were,

1683
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:11,600
if we turned them face
up, we can figure out

1684
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,840
what's the game theory optimal
pushing range for him, right?

1685
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:18,460
When we turn our king, queen up,
if he could play perfect poker,

1686
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,216
he would have
pushed a 24% range.

1687
01:04:20,216 --> 01:04:22,340
That would be king, nine
suited; any ace; any pair;

1688
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,980
queen, ten suited; king,
10 offsuit, or better.

1689
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,040
If we think he is
pushing less than that,

1690
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,120
it's definitely a fold for us.

1691
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,930
If he is pushing more
than that, it's a call.

1692
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:35,440
So we now have established
what a break even

1693
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,320
range is for us facing a
push from a short stack

1694
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,330
at the end of a tournament in
a tournament type that we play.

1695
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:46,450
So next time that we're
sitting in the big blind,

1696
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,850
and we face a shove from
a short stack, who's

1697
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,470
in the small blind,
we have a better idea

1698
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,719
of what things to look at
and how much to skew things

1699
01:04:53,719 --> 01:04:54,510
based on his range.

1700
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,250
If you're starting
to see 50%, 60%,

1701
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,930
and you're sitting with king,
queen, you're in a great spot

1702
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:02,690
to call, assuming you're in
a otherwise similar situation

1703
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,290
with your chips relative
to the rest of the table.

1704
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:09,720
But in this spot, against
this guy, it's a fold.

1705
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,550
So of course, in the
actual tournament,

1706
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:16,455
hero called because you
always make the wrong play

1707
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:18,080
the first time you're
in the situation.

1708
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,970
So hero called here with
king, queen offsuit.

1709
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:24,700
And we get a lovely,
wonderful flop.

1710
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,280
We've got the king, nine, two.

1711
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,470
So hurray, we hit our pair.

1712
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:29,840
This is great.

1713
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,487
Your heart starts racing.

1714
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:32,195
There's the turn.

1715
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:33,580
It's an offsuit seven.

1716
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,230
Fantastical.

1717
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,880
If he has two diamonds, he
doesn't have a flush yet.

1718
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,920
None of the straights came in.

1719
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,170
Uh-oh.

1720
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:41,170
There's another diamond.

1721
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,470
So now if he has two diamonds,
he could have a flush.

1722
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,687
One of the hands that was
in his range was ace, king.

1723
01:05:46,687 --> 01:05:48,270
If he has ace, king,
he also beats is.

1724
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:52,580
So if he has queens, kings,
aces, ace king, or any two

1725
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,370
diamonds, he wins.

1726
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:58,240
And of course, his actual
hand was ace, five offsuit.

1727
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,280
I want to point out
that ace, five offsuit

1728
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,060
was not in our range
analysis for him.

1729
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,400
So our range was
actually too tight.

1730
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,130
So in the future,
when we're trying

1731
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,050
to do this kind of analysis, we
can update our range by saying,

1732
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,480
hey, the last time I
did an analysis of a guy

1733
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,190
that I thought was really
tight, when he was super short,

1734
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,770
he was looser than I thought.

1735
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,280
You can add those
extra few percent

1736
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:29,420
in when you're updating
your ranges later.

1737
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,660
No worries about ace, king.

1738
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,451
Certainly no flush.

1739
01:06:31,451 --> 01:06:33,920
He did have one diamond though.

1740
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,750
So here are our take aways.

1741
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:41,810
You should think about poker as
a series of discrete decisions

1742
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:44,430
that you're going to
make when you're playing.

1743
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:46,810
You can use PokerTracker's
filter system

1744
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:49,890
to target those very
specific decisions.

1745
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,640
As we've seen, you can
filter for anything

1746
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,000
under the sun you would like.

1747
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,520
You can save filters for later.

1748
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,520
So target those.

1749
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,480
Pick the spots that bug you.

1750
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,440
Pick the spots that
you're going to remember.

1751
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,590
Next time you have six, six,
and you're out of position,

1752
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:04,759
and it's on the flop, and
there's a king up there,

1753
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:06,800
and you made a raise
preflop, and you're not sure

1754
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,770
whether you should bet
or you should check,

1755
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:10,686
you can pick that spot
and you can look at it.

1756
01:07:10,686 --> 01:07:13,850
And when you check, call,
then the turn is a queen,

1757
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:16,360
you can decide, do I want to
check or do I want to bet.

1758
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,580
You can pick these spots.

1759
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:21,126
And then when the river 10
comes, it just sucks to be you.

1760
01:07:21,126 --> 01:07:23,040
You can use the
available information

1761
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,950
to build a mental model
of your opponents.

1762
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:27,280
Look, this is the way
people play poker.

1763
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,379
You try to imagine what's going
on in your opponent's head.

1764
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,420
You try to go, how is this
player going to think.

1765
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,820
How does he make decisions.

1766
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,965
So that's what I'm
calling this mental model.

1767
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:38,340
It's all of the
heuristics that's

1768
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:43,480
going on in his head or her head
to make a specific decision.

1769
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,514
Analyze your options based
on your mental model.

1770
01:07:45,514 --> 01:07:46,680
Think about what you can do.

1771
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,130
Think about how his actions
are going to affect your play.

1772
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:51,780
Think about how your
hand affects it.

1773
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,760
And when your mental model
is proven wrong, like it just

1774
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,340
was, we did not think that
guy had ace, five offsuit,

1775
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,630
you can adjust your model.

1776
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:02,880
And you will get better at
poker if you continue to analyze

1777
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,900
your game one hand at the time.

1778
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,720
So I hope that that
was instructive

1779
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,740
and that I opened your eyes
a little bit to all the power

1780
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:17,080
that PokerTracker
has to offer for you.

1781
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:20,030
If you have any questions,
I'd be happy to take them.

1782
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:24,880
